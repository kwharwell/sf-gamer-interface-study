umm the whole counterclockwise trying to move in the control zone is really iffy for me,1,1,404,8,8,319,TRUE,1,
i need it to go slower i need it to calm down,1,1,52,8,8,801,TRUE,1,
p alright that was really frustrating because it kind of got stuck in an endless loop in between both sides,1,1,558,3,3,15,TRUE,1,

mumbles out go back in mumbles move or stay inside okay,1,1,26,8,8,125,TRUE,1,
haha i think my ultimate strategy here is to really not even worry about the control zone because it is so hard to stay in,1,1,404,2,2,78,TRUE,1,
oh ive gotten to slow down officially now,1,1,113,8,8,488,TRUE,1,
so just constantly moving,1,1,400,1,1,48,TRUE,1,
turn go forward go forward there you go forward turn,1,1,210,5,5,55,TRUE,1,
for this game we are going to try and do originally what the goal of the game is to fly in a hexagon around the fortress periodically shooting it for some reason it has not shot at me yet,1,1,848,7,7,331,TRUE,1,
pokay mouse right,0,0,55,1,1,539,TRUE,0,

alright,0,0,558,10,10,76,TRUE,0,
its just the amount you press the acceleration key like it pushes you forward,1,1,214,5,5,305,TRUE,1,
going too fast going too fast,1,1,319,9,9,221,TRUE,1,
i am trying to navigate but nothing is working and im just flying around without oh there we go,1,1,20,1,1,396,TRUE,1,

ahh alright that is t u j,0,0,20,2,2,427,TRUE,0,
maybe i should move in a circle because my best score came when i got 0 kills but moved in a circle,1,1,400,4,4,89,TRUE,1,
ok theres ok 24 i almost got it and if i stay in the center and outside the hexagon i should have the theres a dollar sign,1,1,569,3,3,136,TRUE,1,

okay this is difficult to control,1,1,52,1,1,485,TRUE,1,
alright 5 hits on the vulnerability counter,0,0,372,2,2,31,TRUE,0,
i dont like going into hyperspace but sometimes hyperspace is the only way you can get away,1,1,804,8,8,372,TRUE,1,
turn turn turn,1,1,127,9,9,264,TRUE,1,
yeah go forward,1,1,28,3,3,140,TRUE,1,
i got no control over this and its bad,1,1,49,2,2,324,TRUE,1,
but im moving i dont,1,1,54,10,10,466,TRUE,1,
going nice and slow,1,1,41,5,5,454,TRUE,1,
yup turn then move,1,1,16,6,6,447,TRUE,1,
its best to use light taps to move the ship around rather than long drawnout ones or else itll get crazy and start flying everywhere,1,1,681,2,2,238,TRUE,1,
im not going to try to go in the clockwise motion im just going to shoot at it and hope for the best,1,1,411,2,2,29,TRUE,1,
oh i still cant control the ship and ive been playing this for a little while now its insane,1,1,214,3,3,248,TRUE,1,
okay gotta get in control,1,1,214,10,10,408,TRUE,1,
mine cane okay gotta really figure out how to control my ship here go the opposite direction so i want okay now im in like a good like,1,1,41,3,3,397,TRUE,1,
were gonna go the optimal path this time alright gonna turn around alright lets gothats not that fast,1,1,818,1,1,7,TRUE,1,
i just care about getting shot because the fortress shoots you very fast,0,0,400,2,2,63,TRUE,0,
alright shot it again,0,0,473,7,7,305,TRUE,0,
alright a so,0,0,473,1,1,164,TRUE,0,
now im lost in hyperspace trying to gain control,1,1,468,7,7,144,TRUE,1,
im missing a lot of point right now,0,0,34,1,1,41,TRUE,0,
alright,0,0,319,2,2,28,TRUE,0,

alright this does nothin,0,0,16,5,5,348,TRUE,0,
so very much needs to slow down,1,1,12,3,3,441,TRUE,1,
alright so for our last trial i will try and stay in the fortress as best as possible following the original game plan of spinning clockwise while trying to avoid the mines and shots,1,1,848,10,10,396,TRUE,1,
d friendly im in a bad spot ah man im not going very fast but not slow either,1,1,404,6,6,234,TRUE,1,
no alright alright ok nope nope turn,1,1,210,3,3,32,TRUE,1,

gimme that right back,0,0,16,6,6,452,TRUE,0,
interval was right,0,0,34,1,1,37,TRUE,0,
alright so this time we will try and not to suffer mumbles this game is a little more just kinda rogue flying around not 100 staying within the boundaries but trying to not go into hyperspace,1,1,848,8,8,363,TRUE,1,
um its not worth going in a circle,1,1,3,3,3,50,TRUE,1,
cant do anything else right,0,0,52,3,3,596,TRUE,0,
im more of a controller person,0,0,53,2,2,58,TRUE,0,
there and zs out 6 7 8 9 losing control losing control 10 oh,1,1,825,6,6,189,TRUE,1,
trying to avoid this hyper space is harder than i thought,1,1,210,6,6,81,TRUE,1,
i could fire at that if i knew how to turn,1,1,52,5,5,690,TRUE,1,
alright thats one dollar sign thats one dollar sign,0,0,16,3,3,199,TRUE,0,
alright come on,0,0,16,9,9,716,TRUE,0,

im just kinda going in circles,1,1,468,6,6,109,TRUE,1,
i didnt turn fast enough,1,1,46,9,9,597,TRUE,1,
i just clicked the right one,0,0,54,4,4,269,TRUE,0,
come on man how fast i gotta click,0,0,16,7,7,540,TRUE,0,
yea i can do l turn it into,0,0,52,5,5,676,TRUE,0,
i feel like everytime i lose slight control i just fly off into space,1,1,12,2,2,424,TRUE,1,
alright nope nope nope nope nope nope nope,0,0,818,2,2,19,TRUE,0,
stop spinning fly direct,1,1,210,4,4,40,TRUE,1,

so much for control points,1,1,12,6,6,541,TRUE,1,
alright thats two down,0,0,16,3,3,244,TRUE,0,
so i guess my strategy is to just go around it and shoot at the fortress and make it go as slow as i can,1,1,211,2,2,31,TRUE,1,
p okay my points never gonna im never gonna get high points cuz i wrap the screen too much so,1,1,16,2,2,171,TRUE,1,
