um just getting a lot more control of my ship,0,404,4,4,143
p alright,0,155,10,10,297
okay were at 3 right now which is nice,0,34,4,4,199
the controls are really the hardest part im having a hard part controlling the ship at all much less worrying about the mines,0,404,1,1,27
i like this speed right here,0,647,2,2,156
flying myself down,0,300,2,2,260
but there are good people playing you join in as a beginnger and theres no space for you and you get discouraged cause these guys are kicking your butt,0,214,3,3,312
alright,0,28,1,1,19
okay move there we go,0,910,2,2,40
still gotta get the interval timing right to identify the mines,0,681,5,5,275
okay alright,0,113,8,8,486
alright slow down x6 babe,0,454,2,2,156
control,0,454,5,5,193
okay slow down,0,51,8,8,334
whoa whoa whoa bro bro bro too fast slow down,0,155,4,4,226
p at the moment it feels like my thoughts are like just how to get around how do i turn like how do i keep straight how do i um do this or do that like,0,825,1,1,23
alright come on lets go,0,568,2,2,40
alright,0,16,5,5,360
slow down,0,51,3,3,74
alright go right go that way go backwards,0,20,5,5,580
slowing down is extremely  difficult so its better to go at an optimal speed constantly or just very slow constatntly,0,12,2,2,398
mumbles backward,0,57,4,4,1032
the iff button is the right button but i clicked the left button,0,468,6,6,114
turn go forward go forward there you go forward turn,0,210,5,5,55
its slowish i guess 4 5 friendly that i cant hit is that one or two dollar signs,0,14,6,6,706
i always look forward never look back,0,155,3,3,216
okay were back inside the hexagon,0,34,7,7,355
we just fly through this,0,57,6,6,1176
alright 1 now im going the other way,0,825,8,8,249
all right,0,57,10,10,1454
stop hitting the thing,0,24,6,6,129
slow down,0,51,8,8,303
so bjq there goes a dollar sign however im trying to stay in control oh god i took 2 bullets bjq its fine,0,130,7,7,338
come on stop choking,0,24,8,8,196
ok let me just get inside the control,0,404,9,9,359
alright here we go,0,28,6,6,248
trying to keep it on the screen,0,739,3,3,32
ah man going out of control here ok bonus if that pops up again im gonna hit it,0,404,10,10,377
p alright the foes are umh,0,372,2,2,21
15 shots left,0,26,10,10,172
dont go too fast,0,432,2,2,145
so i should stop missing,0,3,7,7,143
im not even staying in the circle,0,51,3,3,63
turn,0,28,3,3,141
alright this is im getting crazy with these controls,0,190,7,7,203
slow down,0,51,6,6,195
okay you know its easier to stay inside the octagon with this thing,0,41,1,1,374
ok now i got a little hang of it still kind of uncontrolled,0,210,2,2,22
alright what is this next one at,0,16,2,2,143
i pressed that too fast,0,12,4,4,487
trying to stay inside the hexagon but its really hard thats why my velocity is at 200,0,130,1,1,240
umm im doing a little bit better i think the control on this game is a lot better on this game than the other games and its the last game so i didnt expect it to be better,0,685,10,10,222
alright,0,404,5,5,177
oh i just realized that if its not a foe you cant even move the iff,0,57,10,10,1448
alright bet,0,16,5,5,429
im trying to concentrate more than anything right now,0,127,3,3,223
im surprised im negative 700 points right now,0,825,1,1,18
mumbles alright,0,568,1,1,16
just fly up fly up,0,30,9,9,495
oh lets get out of here and hyperspace,0,34,7,7,354
alright,0,16,5,5,359
once i have the ship flying on autopilot in my head i will get better at the game,0,681,1,1,213
no i didnt want to turn,0,33,9,9,846
turns out it was,0,41,1,1,379
we can sacrifice pointer control for velocity and points and see how that works,0,848,5,5,309
slow down,0,51,6,6,217
immeadiately moves and gets hit,0,12,3,3,452
let myself fly across,0,20,8,8,690
forward,0,57,3,3,916
z the interval im doing is too fast thats the first dollar sign zvg thats good,0,130,5,5,310
i am not what how do i there we go i slowed down and im dead,0,41,2,2,405
moving way too fast,0,3,9,9,178
i hate this e with a stick on it and how it goes in a circle it bothers me,0,113,10,10,527
p alright,0,685,1,1,20
got hit right off the bat,0,46,9,9,577
p im still attempting to fly in a counterclockwise direction but its a lot harder than i anticipated it but i feel like im getting the hang of it slowly,0,45,2,2,15
three i see the dollar sign i see the y thats a good mine four velocity four vulnerability points,0,41,1,1,382
so oh it left,0,57,4,4,975
control,0,29,8,8,557
i like how they define the bounds how when you hit it out bounce right off,0,214,4,4,336
slow down,0,12,2,2,410
alright,0,28,7,7,284
try to slow down,0,46,9,9,569
turn turn turn back the other way,0,127,1,1,200
getting it under control is the hardest thing,0,211,2,2,32
okay gained some control there we go,0,818,6,6,129
unfortunately it went out of control again,0,848,2,2,249
it goes half forward half left,0,57,3,3,918
turn,0,56,2,2,26
ok thats off to a bad start already slow it down,0,468,7,7,146
so forward,0,57,2,2,804
its a foe no too slow,0,34,1,1,43
mumbles alright im just trying to control whats going on im just all over,0,190,10,10,227
ah ok no but i get slower so i can usually avoid enemy mines,0,404,4,4,170
alright,0,29,2,2,365
this is harder to control,0,38,1,1,161
right oh lord,0,24,1,1,17
i cant hit the fortress but i have one shot left come on,0,685,7,7,149
but i also that i controlling this properly,0,54,5,5,394
i mean im always in hyperspace anyway,0,53,8,8,367
shooting at it too fast,0,14,10,10,841
control the ship,0,454,6,6,209
okay gonna go a lot slower,0,24,2,2,52
alright 6 7 alright,0,647,10,10,248
p thats a lot harder than i thought it would be i didnt think it would be that sensitive to the touch and everything and your first instinct is to back thrust and you cant do that though to slow down or anything so,0,685,1,1,22
slow down,0,51,4,4,96
umm especially with the mine coming at you faster and youre trying to avoid the bullets from the fortress as well,0,685,6,6,135
okay alright,0,454,1,1,127
its must easier to just circle it,0,12,10,10,677
alright,0,454,6,6,215
so slowly moving to okay nothing now,0,14,1,1,482
aright,0,16,8,8,650
alright im just gonna circle around the horizon,0,16,9,9,723
points are at 800 somethings but control and velocity are in the high positives,0,848,9,9,386
p alright,0,51,8,8,297
no were off into hyperspace,0,818,4,4,81
go you got move,0,51,10,10,462
why cant i circle this shit,0,16,3,3,215
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,7,7,584
i dont like going into hyperspace but sometimes hyperspace is the only way you can get away,0,804,8,8,372
then the next one comes moves way too easily,0,34,6,6,292
okay so right now the enemy mine is chasing i cant even turn around to shoot cause its so hard,0,130,3,3,275
turn man come on,0,127,4,4,236
alright this is a lot harder than i thought it would be,0,28,1,1,45
turn turn turn,0,127,4,4,235
so i guess my strategy is to just go around it and shoot at the fortress and make it go as slow as i can,0,211,2,2,31
no no no turn,0,818,9,9,232
im going too fast im out of control but we can fix that,0,319,9,9,215
i shot too fast to reset the vulnerability counter,0,12,4,4,477
alright,0,16,8,8,651
alright,0,400,1,1,105
negative 813 ship was damaged 13 times i was damaged twice by the mines and i screen warped 28 times,0,825,3,3,124
p oh alright,0,404,1,1,18
alright this is a good strategy for me here i might not get a lot of points but i might actually,0,404,7,7,266
damn alright friend,0,473,8,8,319
that was off real off oops back to the optimal method of losing control of my ship,0,818,5,5,83
got the bonus right just gotta shoot it,0,404,4,4,152
did not react fast enough,0,12,6,6,545
alright,0,16,1,1,40
alright,0,28,2,2,88
i need to slow down,0,53,8,8,388
going off screen you need to control your speed,0,51,6,6,178
p stop bumping into the fortress,0,50,8,8,87
alright oh n is enemy they move very fast by the time i look down and register hes almost on top of me,0,404,6,6,219
using the joystick with my left hand,0,53,4,4,162
avoid getting shot trying to go a little slower,0,24,1,1,19
umm if i dont move fast enough then the fortress will shoot me,0,404,1,1,41
alright i think i clicked it too rapidly and now this thing is coming to kill me,0,558,5,5,34
you didnt wanna pull back and slow down,0,647,3,3,174
i ran into that one like i completely lost control,0,825,6,6,185
i was like i knew controlling the ship was going to be pretty difficult but i didnt realize that everything was going to be so fast paced,0,404,4,4,126
alright,0,20,6,6,601
so youre kinda just not playing with any direction literally and figuratively because controlling it is hard as hell,0,977,9,9,112
just a little push and it goes really fast,0,54,2,2,326
go right go straight,0,20,6,6,603
just starting flying away,0,113,7,7,467
there okay now i can move,0,16,2,2,135
all right here we go,0,55,2,2,599
its very instinctual to press the key as fast as you can and thats not what youre supposed to do,0,12,4,4,498
alright this is the last game i gotta do a lot better than ive been doing,0,685,10,10,213
all right,0,55,4,4,732
p i dont see how anybody can fly this thing clockwise around this thing,0,127,6,6,251
slow down slow down,0,53,5,5,208
i kinda feel like in an intense situation like that you have to act quicker but if its gonna get out of control,0,647,10,10,247
p oh friend or foe mouse right counterclockwise got it,0,53,2,2,39
i was right,0,57,8,8,1315
two personal space,0,53,6,6,266
slow down,0,53,7,7,339
flying all over the place,0,190,1,1,143
control was significantly worse,0,3,4,4,75
slowly,0,300,1,1,236
alright come on,0,127,6,6,256
there and zs out 6 7 8 9 losing control losing control 10 oh,0,825,6,6,189
keep control of the ship,0,454,2,2,157
this isnt space physics surprisingly im not that low on points,0,41,2,2,400
nah thats just cuz im clicking too fast,0,30,9,9,509
going in a circle is another thing,0,468,6,6,115
alright im going to try this again,0,20,9,9,734
it moves differently sometimes,0,211,2,2,21
p its kind of hard to control the iff its friendly so,0,50,1,1,7
p the right hand on the mouse,0,57,4,4,985
so now im consistently shooting the fortress being able to kill it getting used to the ships control more getting used to flying around in a frictionless environment and compensating on the turns,0,681,1,1,218
oop the screen went black,0,411,1,1,14
mumbling turn around turn around go go go straight there,0,210,5,5,64
slow it down,0,454,7,7,223
not moving at all ok,0,569,1,1,151
still not able to control the speed quite too well for the turning,0,848,2,2,258
alright its a mine,0,24,1,1,23
alright,0,28,9,9,371
the control is a little loose,0,210,1,1,4
alright so,0,568,1,1,8
stop on screen,0,51,8,8,316
okay so this is definitely the best flight pattern,0,12,8,8,613
p mouse left,0,51,5,5,126
once it starts going fast its really hard to,0,404,10,10,380
now if i kind of go around the edge of the screen its a lot easier and a lot more time umm im still worried about points,0,404,5,5,186
turn and i died,0,28,6,6,278
alright straight right,0,20,7,7,680
if i could slow down enough to stqay in the thing,0,569,5,5,192
forward,0,51,8,8,339
ill just fly around until theres another bonus,0,3,7,7,144
alright 25 shots,0,685,10,10,224
all right so thatll take like forever to get used to i guess,0,12,1,1,345
i need to slow down bad,0,52,5,5,667
uzn right click in the interval,0,52,7,7,724
okay go forward do that,0,818,2,2,29
p just space button,0,404,1,1,46
p yeah do i press space bar,0,568,1,1,29
yea thats right,0,53,7,7,295
im flying in circles a bunch,0,468,6,6,120
alright here we go,0,28,8,8,365
p um alright,0,3,1,1,3
go forward,0,55,1,1,547
now turn this way,0,51,9,9,346
still dint move fast enough,0,12,3,3,445
alright that one mumbles,0,190,9,9,220
going slowly across,0,300,4,4,305
im just going in and out of warp zone right now,0,404,3,3,91
fly up,0,30,10,10,528
come on go forward a little bit,0,14,4,4,619
rotating slowly,0,300,4,4,312
mumbles okay stop killing me,0,113,6,6,433
alright ill try to at least destroy the fortress at least once if i hit it,0,804,4,4,272
p alright i hit it,0,404,5,5,185
i keep going in circles,0,468,6,6,132
so turn,0,57,1,1,733
it looks like a fly,0,57,6,6,1168
finally stopped getting hit immediately,0,24,2,2,68
p gotta slow down gotta slow down thats foe,0,50,8,8,96
turn and oh dead,0,28,3,3,143
alright,0,28,2,2,102
trying to regain control,0,319,5,5,121
alright thats one dollar sign thats one dollar sign,0,16,3,3,199
alright this is pretty crazy,0,190,2,2,153
try to do a fly by,0,818,6,6,146
okay slow down and aim and fire,0,28,4,4,178
dr right click,0,52,5,5,665
what left,0,51,10,10,398
i wanna get a positive one in this i cant really see theres the second one fik dodging the mines is hard i cant go counterclockwise e thats fine 7 vulnerability 8,0,130,9,9,385
p alright,0,804,10,10,397
and the other is where youre moving and its so hard to do it with just one hand,0,214,1,1,252
face forward,0,57,1,1,734
oh had to turn around,0,647,4,4,188
get back in control,0,319,10,10,257
alright im only going to shoot why i know thats a friend so bang bang,0,20,10,10,803
oh i flew right into you i tried,0,113,5,5,419
hit space to pause the game,0,57,7,7,1255
okay perfect its missing me so im doing good right now,0,34,10,10,478
nope nope slow down no slow the f come on man,0,16,10,10,808
alright thats a foe,0,473,7,7,299
i keep going into hyperspace though,0,34,2,2,73
now i gotta remember to look down at the bottom of the screen,0,568,2,2,39
okay alright were gonna go the optimal path now,0,818,3,3,43
crush him right,0,300,2,2,264
p supposed to stay inside this hexagon,0,50,3,3,28
trying to get out of the way of the shooting there was just 2 dollar signs i was able to pick up the bonus but was right after shot by the whats it called fortress,0,848,3,3,286
p alright i got one more shot,0,16,10,10,754
turn turn,0,57,1,1,770
please slow down,0,825,4,4,144
i just want you to slow down,0,300,3,3,290
too fast slow down again,0,300,1,1,247
i only got 8 shots left,0,49,6,6,387
in the hexagon in the hexagon,0,28,1,1,41
p but i feel like im starting to get the hang of it a little bit except that the joystick is very sensitive so i keep flying all over the place,0,45,1,1,7
p alright zmr are the foe mines,0,372,6,6,72
mub right click oh,0,52,1,1,461
forward,0,57,2,2,808
come on get that control up there we go,0,454,3,3,168
umm its still i think the hardest thing is identifying the bonuses cuz you have so much on the screen,0,685,7,7,159
turn and thrust and then turn and then thrust,0,53,10,10,472
umm i still have to get used to how sensitive the controller er the joystick is,0,468,2,2,26
lets gentle movements and see if that can actually help me,0,52,1,1,462
stop,0,57,1,1,738
alright that is a c so that is a friendly,0,910,2,2,42
p its hard to move,0,211,2,2,19
slow the fword okay,0,16,8,8,617
too fast in every direction,0,14,2,2,510
im flying counter clockwise im trying to,0,372,1,1,9
i just wish i could use my right hand,0,53,2,2,60
straight right straight right and left left straight oh ok straight make a right go back go straight alright come on,0,20,7,7,661
slowly rotate,0,300,1,1,254
p  alright,0,319,4,4,92
yeah x i dont know what you are so im just  going to fly away yay,0,113,7,7,464
you can only apply thrust when going forward if this game was a game i was playing in the past i would assume when going left then go right youd go right but you want you have to go right then straight which is like odd,0,977,2,2,84
i dont know if i shot him or it hit me  something happened ah stop,0,113,3,3,380
p slow down,0,50,4,4,46
alright,0,739,10,10,106
its like moving it,0,57,4,4,990
alright,0,190,2,2,154
actually staying in the control zone more than i thought it would,0,404,8,8,322
nice double tap slow down,0,910,8,8,191
oops see now im completely out of control,0,319,2,2,31
alright destroyed,0,33,1,1,421
alright this is way more,0,825,1,1,4
p like if youre flying close or risking to take a good shot or a bad shot knowing you can take the hit,0,977,9,9,111
i just realized that i have 15 shots alright then,0,558,8,8,62
l alright you my dog,0,16,8,8,641
dont know if thats right,0,3,10,10,219
p no no i wish i did i just gotta get a hold of the controls for the most part i was actually like spinning around inside the hexagon a little bit but it was just that those mines really like got me scared a little bit and i just like lost control and like ok how do i get this back,0,568,2,2,58
please stop do,0,57,9,9,1371
slow down a little,0,685,8,8,172
need to slow down,0,28,8,8,343
alright imma just work like this,0,16,3,3,233
right heres another thing that im supposed to get but i think that was the first one but im honestly not paying attention to that,0,47,1,1,7
alright there we go,0,214,2,2,274
i think im keeping that thats an enemy oh the interval is too fast my interval keeps im probably thinking too much,0,130,3,3,272
p alright omv omv omv omv omv,0,910,2,2,27
do i just press spacebar to continue,0,30,1,1,53
but now i am going way too fast again,0,848,2,2,244
p alright,0,568,2,2,35
going a little too fast but ill go with it,0,46,8,8,528
alright get out that shit,0,16,10,10,820
and turn,0,57,2,2,838
ummmmm i just dont wanna go as fast,0,57,1,1,727
im going too slow,0,16,2,2,126
p yeah like between right there and where you spawn,0,211,4,4,50
alright still getting killed by the enemy mines all the time they come on the screen pretty fast so i have to look immediately down,0,681,2,2,231
like the immediate access you have the illusion you have of moving the joystick there was like a split second of thought that went before,0,977,1,1,80
alright i think this is try number 6 or 7,0,49,7,7,439
yeah this is not very much because im having to use my left hand this is not very much of a competition i dont think,0,127,2,2,205
oh there was a mine on the screen,0,432,5,5,176
alright lets do this,0,319,8,8,192
turn turn turn,0,127,10,10,285
p oh man i was only 4000 points alright,0,558,1,1,7
alright come on,0,51,4,4,112
turn around,0,57,7,7,1205
and then i really wish you could slow down any other way,0,12,2,2,405
im not even worrying about the mines right now because im still trying to get the hang of the controls so im just focusing on killing fortress so once i get that down i can start to work on the mines,0,681,1,1,212
circles,0,26,7,7,117
bonus left,0,27,6,6,111
no that was too fast,0,33,5,5,612
to the left too much,0,300,3,3,287
it seems that if i just flick it the smallest amount it goes the velocity the game requires and that the fortress is unable to hit me and i am still able to turn and make shots okay,0,848,2,2,243
yup turn then move,0,16,6,6,446
i mean being able to control this thing is just,0,127,6,6,252
p uninterpretable 410 alright so i press continue,0,16,1,1,87
n is friendly alright the fortress is at 8 9 10 and its destroyed,0,848,10,10,400
since whenever you move in ac ertain direction you keep moving in that direction,0,12,5,5,522
turn shoot turn shoot turn shoot turn shoot turn,0,113,3,3,374
if i turn the opposite way,0,57,1,1,740
3644 smaller and smaller but yea i have a new appreciation for keyboard controls,0,155,6,6,262
not many people unintelligible feel like my biggest issue is controlling the ship since the ship doesnt stop at all,0,804,5,5,291
mub ok i need to turn that into,0,52,1,1,449
im also getting better at unconsciously flying around and shooting this thing in the middle,0,681,4,4,259
thats a good speed thats to fast thats to fast,0,52,2,2,498
second money sign 1 2 3 4 5 6 s thats a good mine 7 8 im in my no no no no no i was doing so well stop,0,41,2,2,396
its at one time right now oh it ok,0,20,2,2,460
slow down,0,28,1,1,25
then again youre in space,0,647,3,3,175
oh no is it too fast,0,34,5,5,229
i think im out of control here,0,468,7,7,158
alright bonus points left missiles,0,16,1,1,4
okay well velocity isnt doing too bad just the points right now which is,0,34,7,7,351
rotate again,0,300,2,2,265
go forward,0,20,8,8,723
i didnt mean to shoot when i moved,0,14,2,2,519
b alright you my friend,0,16,2,2,144
move,0,28,6,6,279
i keep forgetting when i need to go backward it doesnt do that,0,54,1,1,316
i gotta stop missing,0,24,5,5,119
need to slow down,0,52,3,3,539
p alright there we go,0,155,8,8,275
i cant fly this thing,0,127,3,3,225
forward,0,57,7,7,1235
i am trying to navigate but nothing is working and im just flying around without oh there we go,0,20,1,1,396
i cant even stay in the circle,0,20,1,1,391
so dont go too fast stay in the lines theres a dollar sign it disappeared,0,468,6,6,104
alright,0,558,4,4,28
okay there we go alright lets go,0,685,5,5,111
no why dont you turn,0,210,7,7,94
alright i am at 11 and i dont think i know exactly what to do there we go,0,558,10,10,71
alright and were just gonna keep following the train,0,818,6,6,137
it doesnt really go forward,0,57,3,3,917
i keep going into hyperspace so that not good losing points,0,34,1,1,39
turn turn turn,0,127,5,5,249
going slower but thats like the first hit,0,46,8,8,537
forward,0,57,2,2,806
p kyx no stop stop flying,0,210,4,4,39
moving too fast,0,14,6,6,699
alright,0,454,7,7,224
the control on this,0,454,1,1,125
turn,0,57,7,7,1207
got the mine alright just keep this speed nope nope nope ill get the hang of this in a couple of more games,0,818,4,4,67
okay wow were at 7 right now,0,34,5,5,252
ok so im definitely not in control right now,0,468,3,3,37
alright thats maybe slightly worse mumble,0,468,3,3,43
okay alright that was rude,0,113,1,1,322
p so i have a little better understanding of what is going on because i actually just realized that i am supposed to like the ship turns and i boost it its not actually moving in the direction if that makes any sense at all,0,558,2,2,9
alright come on come here,0,16,8,8,645
okay alright got some points,0,30,2,2,105
p its more harder if you try to stay inside the hexagon,0,658,5,5,39
alright q,0,16,4,4,300
my control has been good,0,825,10,10,299
in hyperspace,0,24,1,1,29
alright thats a friend,0,473,7,7,297
so its probably better to just move around,0,54,6,6,405
okay stay within the lines mumble hyperspace,0,804,10,10,419
okay alright im just going to keep doing this its going to work,0,113,10,10,528
alright,0,319,5,5,112
im stillwow mumbles a lot here i cant keep flying around like this,0,214,6,6,368
alright so instructions,0,16,4,4,265
keep going into hyperspace,0,804,5,5,287
move toward it,0,300,9,9,405
i lost control,0,818,5,5,117
out of control,0,319,5,5,131
quails stop x rays,0,53,10,10,465
p aright,0,54,1,1,298
and we are spinning out of control,0,848,7,7,337
no hyperspace,0,818,6,6,145
forward,0,300,1,1,246
inaudible okay one life left per game,0,27,2,2,31
this is just alright this is just how imma do it,0,16,3,3,239
going too fast but i missed the first missile and i slowed it down,0,46,9,9,558
now i am spinning out of control but the mine is friendly unfortunately i just ran into it and did not get any points,0,848,3,3,273
1 alright mumbles alright 3 on the vulnerability counter,0,372,7,7,86
im just gonna move like this nope that aint gonna work,0,16,9,9,728
going too fast again,0,46,8,8,535
move forward,0,57,1,1,752
alright come on,0,16,9,9,716
so now we need like more bullets cause im missing a lot of these bullets moving around too much a d so an enemy mine however i cant really shoot it bonus should use it for missiles,0,130,6,6,329
like i have to be between the hexagons to actually shoot it,0,57,8,8,1340
try to do a fly by,0,818,6,6,147
yeah moving slower on this is much easier,0,400,2,2,114
im still completely out of control,0,468,4,4,61
nope thats not slow,0,33,4,4,585
slowly slowly,0,14,1,1,454
slowly,0,28,4,4,174
ship doesnt slow down at all,0,804,1,1,240
alright,0,214,7,7,375
now its really the mines cause i realized the fortress doesnt really shoot like i can easily dodge like move away from its shots umm so like the mines are doing things to me now,0,411,7,7,106
come on move forward move forward,0,55,10,10,1016
i can like just mmm mumbles alright stop moving,0,568,2,2,49
i always hate this  all right that didnt work,0,804,5,5,283
p that is a friendly mine obviously out of control ok,0,404,5,5,190
did not wanna do that now im just flying straight at the fort,0,14,3,3,553
whatever im gonna okay i dont care if i go out of bounds,0,16,1,1,58
technically i risk being stuck in a bad movement,0,400,10,10,141
come on turn and shoot turn and shoot turn and shoot,0,16,8,8,643
thats y thatll be stuff staying inside the hexagon finally,0,130,7,7,355
okay alright oh i didnt see you,0,113,5,5,423
oh i tried to slow down by pressing the stick backwards,0,411,6,6,91
alright,0,16,3,3,212
forward,0,57,2,2,792
4 clockwise,0,52,1,1,427
it only goes forward right and left,0,54,1,1,312
there alright thats one,0,16,4,4,309
p alright closer to zero,0,16,3,3,255
p so the controls here basically,0,38,1,1,148
control the ship,0,454,5,5,190
right click in the interval,0,52,7,7,740
let me try to slow down,0,3,7,7,135
it takes a lot of control like i know if my brother were to try this he would be very like frantic and that wouldnt be like that would be difficult like hes,0,825,5,5,161
second one nice 40 shots left,0,130,2,2,257
i need to slow down,0,53,4,4,192
very small movements nothing crazy you dont need to do much,0,41,9,9,592
im actually at negative points right now,0,568,1,1,19
but if i move too fast ill lose control,0,404,1,1,42
alright,0,53,7,7,303
the tiniest movement wow wow wow,0,214,1,1,259
alright come on i got the turn game now,0,16,5,5,381
fly up fly up fly up fly up,0,30,10,10,522
shes seen me play basketball with my left hand,0,127,1,1,192
yeah definitely going too fast,0,468,3,3,41
the interval is 2 right now ah theres a mine its a friendly mine so its ok,0,404,3,3,89
going a little too fast i gotta compensate,0,681,2,2,228
thats the other space fortress,0,130,2,2,253
turn around turn around shoot it shoot,0,113,2,2,342
cant control this thing alright im moving in the right direction oh wow okay good,0,214,4,4,323
my left hand cant respond to nothin,0,16,4,4,293
alright two hand is not working so back to one,0,20,7,7,644
all right,0,57,2,2,844
so were at 6 right now 7 8 9 10 11 12 okay that was one dollar sign,0,14,7,7,725
stay on the screen,0,569,8,8,225
and for this game i will try to go as slow as possible which right out of the bat already is not happening,0,848,3,3,268
alright,0,825,7,7,213
come on turn around turn,0,127,5,5,246
alright umm no no no okay just gotta ive still yet to get any bonus points or anything,0,685,1,1,19
p oh ok sorry i was like super into this right now,0,190,8,8,212
turn turn,0,210,4,4,46
thats not the alright,0,28,1,1,50
oh get back on the screen,0,739,5,5,53
thats the hardest part honestly im just trying to control the thing umm and not go into warp speed gonna try to shoot a little bit,0,404,2,2,61
stop,0,411,6,6,93
oh this is even faster this is not good okay i think im worried,0,130,1,1,227
p im gonna stay in this hexagon,0,50,9,9,112
getting out of control,0,319,4,4,100
alright,0,404,2,2,72
going slowly,0,46,7,7,483
didnt get hit right away,0,804,7,7,313
yeah go forward,0,28,3,3,140
going into hyperspace,0,468,9,9,198
just trying to get a slow kinda like slide past the tower,0,24,4,4,96
oh alright so the hardest thing is not making any huge movements,0,319,2,2,19
thats a bracket lost all controls,0,14,5,5,636
slow down,0,51,10,10,402
slow down,0,51,7,7,256
i feel like going slow works the best,0,739,3,3,35
forward,0,57,3,3,914
turn,0,56,1,1,12
one personal space,0,53,6,6,256
im trying to turn,0,33,4,4,571
p cant go too fast,0,432,4,4,163
alright just coast,0,818,4,4,72
once you go a little too fast its almost impossible,0,12,10,10,678
alright,0,26,4,4,46
slow down or just fly off randomly i guess,0,14,4,4,616
i almost died but i got it and i only have 136 points right now so im doing a lot better than ive been doing,0,685,7,7,157
alright i got 1500 points more this time really excited,0,558,2,2,13
slow down,0,51,10,10,455
i do not want to be going that fast,0,818,2,2,30
p alright are people usually this bad,0,20,2,2,419
alright this does nothin,0,16,5,5,348
its slow down,0,12,7,7,587
stop hitting me stop coming,0,113,3,3,381
i think my control is going in vain,0,57,7,7,1216
whatcha alright come here,0,16,10,10,770
im at 4 right now as far as the vulnerability 6 7 we are now at 0 shots so a bonus would be beneficial,0,848,7,7,349
alright beef,0,16,7,7,509
ok ok slow down,0,569,6,6,205
alright imma get it back,0,16,10,10,811
i thought that was right,0,16,3,3,209
alright i gotta keep shooting im at vulnerability 3 thought i was higher damn,0,404,10,10,387
and okay yeah there we go there we go slowing down now,0,41,6,6,502
i definitely like joystick in the right hand better,0,46,2,2,332
turn around,0,57,2,2,855
turn,0,788,4,4,170
i bet i know how to move,0,16,1,1,48
trying to move it slowly control it like the keyboard,0,432,4,4,164
just go to the right,0,818,9,9,218
their processing speed is just so fast and their fire rate is insane,0,211,8,8,111
alright slow down,0,16,4,4,305
stop shooting me,0,818,10,10,256
ohh vulnerability is gone too fast,0,211,7,7,93
speed is alright this time,0,46,7,7,479
alright get out the way,0,16,4,4,325
it seems i do a little better going counterclockwise round instead of clockwise,0,558,4,4,20
im missing a lot of point right now,0,34,1,1,41
and i cant even turn,0,16,4,4,294
too bad i keep losing points because i keep going into hyperspace,0,804,7,7,340
come on its way too fast,0,46,6,6,451
no turn,0,33,9,9,832
forward,0,53,10,10,462
go forward,0,51,5,5,169
slowly move,0,14,8,8,790
wow okay thats i think i have one more hit left,0,34,6,6,285
alright try to keep going in a counterclockwise shape,0,28,3,3,125
okay alright,0,113,9,9,507
and ive just lost control,0,818,4,4,76
there are other important things like fast enough where you can dodge the fortress but slow enough to where you can shoot the fortress that middle ground was i back to zero on that one,0,432,6,6,184
i thats a friendly alright im at 10,0,404,9,9,342
i should just be a hyperspace pilot,0,53,3,3,124
alright trying to get into a good path,0,319,3,3,50
alright,0,818,5,5,106
just gonna do fly bys okay were gonna try to gain control and were gonna,0,818,4,4,78
ill just take that hit i guess and control for it,0,12,9,9,657
no alright alright ok nope nope turn,0,210,3,3,32
okay going too fast,0,12,4,4,495
um its not worth going in a circle,0,3,3,3,50
slow down,0,51,7,7,235
out of control still,0,319,10,10,258
slow,0,210,8,8,135
p okay so this time im gonna go even slower,0,214,4,4,319
umm t nope that was too fast,0,404,7,7,251
aww now its real fast oh crap,0,211,7,7,92
i feel like going in circles increases points,0,647,7,7,226
p is it just the keyboard and the controller that i need to do,0,40,4,4,97
now im flying too fast,0,3,8,8,165
yeah i dont have any control,0,57,6,6,1191
okay back in control,0,818,5,5,118
p im doing better at staying in the hexagon well i was doing better at staying in the hexagon,0,45,7,7,76
hopefully itll offset some of the 1000 because im flying in circles,0,468,4,4,59
its just way much more ummmmm lack of control,0,57,8,8,1346
like i said before until you really master the controls of this thing its like you really cant do anything else with the game thats what it seems to me,0,127,8,8,271
i am spinning out of control,0,848,10,10,403
1 2 3 got the bonus 4 5 6 6 7 8 9 10 alright now im at 440,0,372,8,8,101
oh that was a fast one,0,20,7,7,683
its best to use light taps to move the ship around rather than long drawnout ones or else itll get crazy and start flying everywhere,0,681,2,2,238
were not going fast enough,0,46,1,1,297
all of the mines they move so fast you have t get that double click first try or itll hit you,0,400,2,2,115
slow down,0,12,9,9,663
slow down,0,739,9,9,89
youre right,0,57,1,1,732
going too fast,0,319,9,9,223
turn stay,0,20,1,1,409
alright umm the vulnerability is still at 0 so i cannot attack the fortress,0,372,1,1,15
and i okay okay ive lost control a little bit,0,685,2,2,30
like right now i cant play and think,0,214,4,4,329
alright,0,54,2,2,324
alright,0,319,2,2,18
screen wrap really takes the points out of my system so if i could just avoid screen wrap then i shouldnt be mumbles,0,404,10,10,374
rotate slowly,0,300,2,2,262
ok so i think im definitely getting the controls a bit more each time its no longer like a umm oh maybe i can start playing the game,0,468,5,5,83
p alright lets get it,0,16,1,1,6
alright things are a little faster than i may have thought they would,0,28,1,1,22
it turned me completely around no i didnt want to go that way,0,818,8,8,198
turn oh wait no nevermind mumbles,0,113,3,3,373
how fast im posta,0,16,6,6,457
i wasnt expecting to be using my left hand um cause im a righthanded person,0,53,1,1,11
stop stop stop stop,0,41,3,3,418
turn,0,210,10,10,168
oh that was too fast,0,28,9,9,378
alright what this is,0,16,5,5,376
mumbles out go back in mumbles move or stay inside okay,0,26,8,8,125
perfect it worked alright so now we are going to continue that by trying to fly at a slow enough velocity to gain points by also staying within the edges of the box so control does not take too much of a hit,0,848,5,5,311
its really hard to stay on course when you have an objective like once i go past 13 im doing circles,0,647,7,7,225
p opposite direction so youre like trying to continuously turn i guess,0,468,2,2,23
come in slow,0,300,7,7,366
mumbles just fly by like this,0,57,10,10,1495
i gotta stop going into space,0,214,9,9,399
ive also just kind of completelt disregardedsp control and velocity at this point and focused on getting mine hits,0,12,3,3,431
it flies too fast,0,20,6,6,607
trying to control my speed,0,319,4,4,88
okay well im kind getting how the movement works,0,34,9,9,417
alright,0,28,1,1,34
im going so fast,0,28,6,6,257
alright oh gotta keep moving,0,28,5,5,223
laughs it takes really slight movements,0,190,1,1,138
was that not fast enough,0,16,9,9,742
it is quite difficult to control,0,848,1,1,239
alright i got a friendly mine n thats,0,404,6,6,226
im controlling it,0,818,10,10,272
these three minutes really go by fast when youre trash,0,41,6,6,515
can i stop,0,127,8,8,275
to the left,0,56,1,1,11
so going counterclockwise around this thing is not even an option for me or clockwise should i say,0,127,2,2,209
yes alright,0,51,5,5,171
alright its getting a little easier now after 7 games im able to oh shoot okay,0,685,7,7,144
alright theres one,0,54,8,8,424
okay im starting to get in a rhythm of moving around and shooting this thing,0,681,4,4,254
i dont know if its cuz i played 10 rounds with the keyboard or the keyboard is less sensitive but i feel like the keyboard gives you more control over the space ship,0,977,2,2,85
so yeah just trying to understand the movement and get the muscle memory down because it might take some time,0,468,3,3,42
if i could just do this slow enough,0,432,6,6,187
alright i dont know who designed this game but its so hard,0,51,3,3,60
74 shots left,0,372,2,2,27
no overturned it,0,28,5,5,227
9 i got 1 more then i gotta start going for the control shot,0,404,7,7,263
im going to preserve my bullets and try to at least alright i got more bullets so im good for a little bit,0,685,4,4,90
ebf right click,0,52,9,9,841
yeah this hexagonal thing is not,0,52,7,7,716
i gotta remember to move immediately,0,404,5,5,200
the red bomb doesnt have to hit you really even if its close it counts like a hit even when i go slowly,0,432,4,4,165
slow down,0,51,7,7,257
alright,0,28,10,10,439
dang i just dont be moving way quick enough,0,16,4,4,290
hyperspace game,0,53,6,6,290
stop on the screen and stop it,0,51,8,8,323
yeah i think i forfeited staying in that um hexagon so now its just a game all about timing and accuracy to hopefully destroy one of these,0,825,4,4,137
its like try to lean forward slowly,0,57,6,6,1123
alright,0,16,1,1,34
im definitely not earning points for the control,0,468,6,6,127
still getting used still trying to stay in the control area for the most part,0,404,1,1,30
make a left,0,20,7,7,651
out of control out of control out of control,0,319,9,9,236
alright lets get it,0,16,3,3,245
at this point i just have to slowly drift off and not get shot at,0,411,8,8,126
im actually going to stay in this hexagon,0,52,3,3,561
quick to fly off the edge,0,14,3,3,567
now im just going in circles,0,57,6,6,1167
alright i which is an enemy mine,0,404,3,3,111
rotate,0,57,5,5,1107
p alright the foe mines are r y and g,0,848,7,7,335
alright,0,28,1,1,64
slow down,0,12,3,3,446
i keep running into stuff alright,0,454,1,1,126
it spins very fast,0,848,1,1,223
i can turn around,0,52,6,6,674
slowly cross,0,300,3,3,285
need to get it to slow down,0,52,3,3,540
oh its faster now i can aim better though this way,0,211,6,6,86
okay im just going to try and go faster,0,34,3,3,135
p i really need to learn to play left handed,0,658,8,8,61
p thrust,0,29,3,3,389
im flying off in a random direction,0,14,1,1,480
alright get outta here,0,16,2,2,154
its off the screen,0,3,4,4,72
left counterclockwise right clockwise,0,52,2,2,474
wanna wait out these mines in hyperspace,0,41,2,2,398
slow down,0,51,4,4,114
speeds more than i would like or velocity,0,46,5,5,407
apparently shooting it does not work so im gonna have to stop doing that,0,804,10,10,411
turn,0,210,6,6,73
its hard to go forward,0,57,5,5,1062
try to go real slow,0,739,5,5,54
and then the fact that backwards on the control pad doesnt do anything,0,404,2,2,64
lets stop lets stop,0,34,8,8,380
the mines i completely forgot about them ive been trying to just get the controls down,0,658,2,2,25
dont move,0,12,4,4,497
going too slow to get away from the mines,0,46,5,5,428
im going too slow,0,12,6,6,556
oh right there,0,454,4,4,180
forward,0,57,7,7,1226
right now im trying to turn around the fortress as best to my ability and learning the controls a little better,0,848,1,1,235
so im supposed to point at them and hit the right mouse button,0,658,2,2,27
slow down,0,51,7,7,233
okay so lets slow down slow down,0,34,9,9,423
turn,0,127,4,4,237
why did you move,0,155,4,4,237
move up over around,0,14,10,10,858
you lose control and its very hard to find it,0,217,2,2,64
alright,0,24,3,3,85
p turn ok,0,210,4,4,48
moving too fast,0,3,7,7,123
p its just really hard to control right now,0,27,1,1,6
no no just flying around,0,818,9,9,228
slow down,0,51,6,6,211
personal space,0,53,6,6,255
left click it gave me the bonus,0,300,5,5,328
okay keep going going to the right and not get hit,0,818,8,8,196
p spacebar,0,55,2,2,553
stay in the hexagon,0,300,2,2,270
alright,0,319,2,2,22
okay alright,0,825,2,2,56
40 shots left,0,54,1,1,304
alright umm see a mine i hit it head on it disappeared so im guessing it didnt do damage and its friendly,0,468,7,7,151
let me keep moving to escape,0,34,2,2,98
okay lets try to maneuver,0,57,9,9,1373
hyperspace my own element mumbles,0,468,7,7,150
one personal space,0,53,6,6,265
my speed is turning,0,130,3,3,282
exp alright,0,41,2,2,392
p um yeah im kinda trying to get it to go as slow as i can because it moves very fast,0,211,2,2,30
p there is no strategy going on here i will tell you that right now im just trying to get a hold of the controls here,0,568,1,1,17
move,0,57,10,10,1490
i died that time right,0,211,4,4,60
okay i dont care if i go out of bounds,0,16,2,2,103
alright now im gonna start shooting the fortress now,0,28,4,4,161
i really dont want this guy to go off the screen but he keeps wanting to do that,0,47,5,5,65
this time also i am able to travel with that clockwise position around the fortress,0,848,4,4,293
okay forward,0,57,7,7,1240
umm alright so i got lucky that it was a friendly mine,0,404,1,1,20
3 4 come on zach alright im going a little fast,0,685,8,8,171
all right so i have z,0,55,8,8,938
its very hard to get any control points or velocity points,0,12,1,1,365
im adjusting flight for the fly by tactic again moving to that side,0,910,2,2,43
all i gotta do is keep gdoing what i was doing keep to the right go slow and well get this eventually,0,818,7,7,190
alright im at vulnerability 6 try to alter my path a little bit,0,404,6,6,229
p xgi mumbles alright so im just going to keep going,0,113,7,7,453
your ship wrapped the screen 42 times,0,53,6,6,289
the biggest problem is definitely keeping this thing under control and then once you do that theres definitely better ways to capitalize on the mines but im pretty sure you can just shoot them all so i dont know,0,47,6,6,95
left,0,20,7,7,657
i must control my movement,0,468,9,9,207
im trying to go right and its not working,0,20,1,1,404
alright you have to be a pro gamer to do well in this game,0,20,7,7,666
velocity is alright,0,46,8,8,543
alright,0,26,5,5,67
or too fast,0,34,1,1,44
stop spinning fly direct,0,210,4,4,40
alright viw,0,20,3,3,493
turning,0,28,6,6,242
i suck at control,0,57,7,7,1201
got me going way too fast,0,46,4,4,397
turn turn,0,28,10,10,446
okay slow go to 10 then rapid fire,0,300,10,10,409
and go forward,0,28,7,7,289
i probably gotta turn the other way,0,16,9,9,696
1528 uninterpretable alright get him out of here,0,16,4,4,333
its very hard to control,0,404,1,1,10
its an ally mine i cant stop myself to shoot,0,130,3,3,285
turn,0,818,10,10,252
alright,0,28,8,8,362
alright got up to 7 that time,0,558,6,6,50
p ah jeez slow down slow down,0,50,5,5,52
i know there bonus points but i dont wanna get hurt if i touch the hexagon,0,57,9,9,1402
not worried about bonuses right now,0,28,3,3,132
trying to stay inside the hexagon for those extra points but its really hard to control,0,130,1,1,231
trying to move forward and rotate,0,300,1,1,238
slow down and turn and move,0,28,10,10,428
gonna complain of my horrible flying,0,14,7,7,737
okay ill just fly around i guess,0,12,2,2,397
still going too fast second dollar sign,0,319,7,7,183
alright stick and move,0,16,4,4,326
so there we slowed down,0,57,4,4,1002
im circling,0,468,8,8,182
so right about now i am thinking i kind of want to be ambidextrous,0,53,4,4,151
why do i keep moving to the center,0,33,2,2,520
stop running into the tower,0,24,7,7,166
p alright umm the hardest part to me is staying inside the hexagon umm and i guess yeah staying inside the hexagon is probably the hardest thing,0,685,2,2,27
just slow down,0,30,5,5,244
gotta get like the right speed,0,43,6,6,158
pretty in control with this o thats a friendly mine oh man i hit the wrong button,0,404,5,5,178
ah gotta keep it on the screen,0,739,5,5,51
come on mumbles lets drive backwards right into it,0,55,1,1,523
okay i can turn this way,0,16,7,7,516
slow down,0,27,6,6,113
hmm not fast enough nope,0,568,2,2,47
forward,0,57,2,2,807
p okay alright so thats a friendly mine,0,28,1,1,60
im getting better at like controlling it,0,43,8,8,185
p alright the foe mines are u i and f and this is with the joystick this time instead of the keyboard,0,848,1,1,221
swipe right,0,27,1,1,19
how are you supposed to go in a circle and shoot,0,739,7,7,73
349 i need to stop shooting i guess,0,569,9,9,245
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,4,4,295
i need to get closer instead of spinning in circles which i dont know how to do,0,52,8,8,756
controlling the spaceship is the hardest thing here,0,28,1,1,51
kinda staying inside the hexagon right now,0,130,6,6,326
im flying,0,57,10,10,1485
turning it around is oh thats a bad mine i cant really shoot,0,130,4,4,301
still holding slow steady,0,41,4,4,463
im gunna try something different im gunna try a fly by tactic,0,910,2,2,36
i got to stay inside this hexagon thing,0,54,10,10,458
oh what if i just turned like this,0,57,5,5,1045
slow down,0,51,7,7,278
i just shoot it and if it doesnt go down i just fly up,0,43,5,5,148
very hard to control,0,12,8,8,617
starting to lose control a little bit,0,432,9,9,212
umm alright,0,28,10,10,448
come on just wanna rotate,0,30,2,2,69
switches from left hand to right hand,0,685,1,1,11
learn how to move,0,16,8,8,672
its so hard im trying to figure out how to control and im trying to shoot,0,214,8,8,385
but also control the speed too,0,54,4,4,358
oh my got its getting faster,0,211,3,3,43
aright come on,0,16,7,7,572
make a right make a left go straight go straight,0,20,7,7,650
the letter is l so im not very good at controlling this,0,3,1,1,12
this is the 5th game and i still have not mastered the flight pattern,0,20,5,5,558
alright and one two oh i missed and died before it,0,825,5,5,172
im ready to fly a real plane now,0,40,3,3,94
there we go slow down,0,51,8,8,317
forward and rotate,0,300,1,1,239
alright,0,16,2,2,119
1 2 3 4 5 at this point im forgetting the letters and just focusing on staying in the circle,0,647,9,9,240
p cxb i need to get a hold of the rotation,0,569,2,2,162
uggghhh go forward,0,30,3,3,133
alright this,0,16,9,9,748
im getting too busy staying in the circle and im forgetting to shoot,0,20,7,7,664
p im getting the interval too fast and i know im doing it too fast whenever i do it its just a habit of clicking it as fast as i can instead of thinking of the time,0,685,6,6,129
control the ship,0,454,5,5,196
then turn,0,57,3,3,950
alright come on,0,16,8,8,670
no forward,0,55,3,3,675
slow down,0,53,3,3,119
turn,0,57,3,3,935
slow down,0,51,4,4,115
alright,0,647,3,3,178
alright what is it,0,16,5,5,365
alright lets get it,0,16,5,5,393
its kind of hard when im warping in and out of the screen i actually managed to hit it,0,404,5,5,183
just trying to keep it on the screen,0,739,3,3,34
is it like i think i think camera that every time i hit the hexagon the little hexagon on the side that the thing is pointing that the fortress is pointing like that i get a vulnerability point,0,49,6,6,392
i feel like everytime i lose slight control i just fly off into space,0,12,2,2,424
control man,0,49,1,1,279
alright i think i did better this time around,0,568,2,2,50
oh alright just hit the enemy mine actually pretty proud of myself when i do that i dont get that much,0,404,6,6,228
p okay alright,0,214,8,8,383
p alright this is probably gonna be worse than the keyboard then if i have to use my left hand,0,127,1,1,181
i cant do this thing lefthanded,0,127,4,4,241
keep going to the right no dont go into hyperspace,0,818,7,7,180
p i am not knowing how to control this,0,568,1,1,11
alright,0,404,8,8,288
little movements x2,0,52,3,3,538
frictionless is right,0,411,1,1,5
interval was right,0,34,1,1,37
p my score got really good really fast,0,825,6,6,201
alright alright gotta slow down someh okay,0,28,1,1,18
so right now we are spinning inside and try to not die,0,848,6,6,329
p im trying to go slow and clockwise,0,50,1,1,9
qcu right click in the interval shoot it,0,52,10,10,890
alright come on friend come on friend come on friend,0,16,2,2,132
i can turn for days,0,57,5,5,1043
its very difficult to control the thing and i wish this guy would stop trying to shoot me and lets see,0,47,1,1,5
no dont dont dont lose control,0,818,8,8,210
especially i think the hardest thing for me right now is figuring out what to like after i gain speed,0,468,2,2,20
no i dont wanna go off the e i went off the edge again,0,14,5,5,639
turn trying to get into a good path trying to get some shots down friendly mine approaching,0,319,2,2,37
ad that its difficult to stay in this hexagon thing,0,54,5,5,377
okay go for it alright turn,0,113,2,2,350
i dont know why they turn to asteroids,0,24,10,10,231
come on  turn the right way,0,55,6,6,822
stop moving so fast slow down slow down,0,16,8,8,616
okay what is this right now,0,34,3,3,132
quails stop x rays because their shells are really hard,0,53,10,10,454
and then why did i rotate way too far and dead,0,14,9,9,825
p counterclockwise,0,26,2,2,12
going too fast,0,46,1,1,301
alright,0,16,5,5,402
p hgt okay if its hg and t stop them if its not well im gunna forget this is only round two,0,825,2,2,46
for one thing it definitely is easier to stay going slower,0,57,2,2,786
alright,0,26,1,1,5
alright just just trying to stabilize,0,30,3,3,127
i cant just stop like i wasnt moving,0,52,7,7,720
im started to go too fast at that,0,12,8,8,616
slow down please,0,41,3,3,417
one dollar sign damn hyperspace,0,468,10,10,216
alright aim and fire thats 6 starting to get better at this,0,825,2,2,70
alright just gonna focus on sp velocity,0,28,3,3,130
alright so yeah 2373,0,568,2,2,52
get control of the ship,0,454,10,10,254
im out of control i see a dollar sign its the first time though second time,0,319,5,5,117
slow passes,0,300,3,3,282
alright,0,28,4,4,179
wrapped around screen 25 times,0,658,2,2,24
they say the best strategy is to stay inside the hexagon but thats really hard to do,0,685,6,6,133
alright this game is impossible,0,20,2,2,441
okay turn oh wow turn,0,113,2,2,349
it was slower,0,53,8,8,393
mumbles going too fast,0,319,3,3,58
try to stay inside of here its not working right now,0,54,3,3,353
alright the fortress already has 2 hits and the dollar sign but unfortunately a punctuation mark happened or a question mark,0,848,3,3,281
trying to figure out how to have better control,0,788,4,4,174
stop stop stop stop stop,0,53,10,10,476
alright so i think i got a pretty good strategy,0,190,8,8,209
just gonna fly around cuz i have no shots,0,43,9,9,197
i need to just slow down but i cant,0,52,1,1,447
all right keep going,0,55,7,7,862
alright cool,0,53,4,4,145
right when i get to the end it kills me,0,404,7,7,277
alright come on,0,16,4,4,307
g is a bad one i was too quick on my interval entered hyperspace,0,41,1,1,375
50 going forward,0,57,3,3,949
atleast i got the bonuses right now,0,210,3,3,28
flying backwards that is how you do it,0,113,10,10,540
uhh alright,0,825,4,4,151
alright we are hitting the fortress better this time but i just realized i am at negative shots so those will now have to be used sparingly or until i receive the next bonus,0,848,6,6,331
alright alabama,0,14,10,10,839
mumbles going too fast going way too fast,0,319,3,3,63
the whole tap thing on the left,0,300,8,8,376
seems if i get too slow i get killed by the center immediately so i have to maintain some velocity,0,681,3,3,242
p yeah alright back to 2,0,558,4,4,26
mumbles i turned it into a,0,52,4,4,583
yea your ship was damaged 13 times and screen wrapped around less than last time,0,53,3,3,133
and it lets me only move the joystick in a very like parallel movements if that makes sense,0,411,10,10,147
alright thats one back,0,16,2,2,142
well i guess if i keep shooting maybe someday ill get something right,0,49,4,4,351
stinkin move,0,16,5,5,404
trying to get back into hexagon,0,130,9,9,408
its not hitting the space station,0,804,8,8,360
ship is going very very fast,0,804,6,6,302
rotate myself and then gently,0,52,2,2,524
now we are spinning around trying to shoot or not get hit by this mine that i just turned into a deadly mine,0,848,4,4,299
22 shots left,0,26,5,5,79
alright lets do this,0,319,6,6,141
alright move,0,54,3,3,350
i can probablyalright,0,214,5,5,355
yeah i think i definitely like the keyboard control much better,0,155,1,1,180
13 shots left,0,26,9,9,159
my reaction time is a little bit slower cause i have to look at the ifs thing remember what the letters were and then shoot at it,0,411,7,7,107
slow down slow down slow down,0,28,10,10,410
mine moving forward again,0,300,9,9,394
vulnerability at 3 which is good im not at total negative points right now,0,804,7,7,333
slow down,0,51,5,5,145
going pretty slowly,0,46,7,7,490
going faster than i would like to,0,46,4,4,379
very quickly hit control im trying to uninterpretable vulnerability is trash,0,41,6,6,510
getting control of this,0,432,2,2,148
ok turn,0,210,5,5,65
alright bvd,0,28,10,10,454
turn around,0,55,7,7,878
so i need to click faster next time between the 2,0,468,6,6,124
oh i shot to fast,0,34,4,4,211
alright best score yet,0,558,7,7,57
rotate slowly,0,14,3,3,547
still going too fast,0,319,5,5,125
okay thats just keep going to the right hyperspaceit,0,818,8,8,206
you just can like go in a circle,0,51,4,4,107
i just want to be more competent with my left,0,53,4,4,157
alright back to zero,0,16,5,5,356
p well just stop after 10,0,681,5,5,265
p make the spacebar a pause button,0,56,6,6,74
i did not wanna go hyper,0,14,3,3,543
so well try one of the techniques of flying off the screen to avoid being hit by the fortress because it shot a lot last game,0,848,8,8,353
p alright it stopped,0,214,7,7,371
no i had 10 velocity,0,34,9,9,414
alright thats one,0,16,4,4,318
that was evenly faster,0,12,9,9,661
wish it didnt shoot right away when the game starts makes it a little difficult,0,34,7,7,338
trying to go slow,0,300,7,7,361
so trying to stay within the hexagon,0,468,7,7,139
alright nope nope nope nope nope nope nope,0,818,2,2,19
because im pretty sure to destroy the mines its tapping the right clicker or i forget i dont really know what exactly to call it but i am not entirely sure if its actually doing anything,0,558,6,6,44
p alright,0,20,3,3,465
umm that hyperspace word makes me want to watch that movie with owen wilson,0,53,3,3,125
still cant control the ship at all,0,569,2,2,166
and turn,0,300,10,10,411
alright i just destroyed the fortress so that strategy seems to work,0,372,5,5,64
left,0,51,10,10,431
p hyperspace,0,848,9,9,367
this is im not really skilled with my left hand,0,127,1,1,190
uzn nice right click nice,0,52,7,7,717
alright thats an e,0,16,7,7,534
ok so if i just move it like that it should work,0,52,2,2,527
4 mumbles mumbles i can control this thing i should nope,0,26,5,5,84
am i clicking too fast i must be,0,52,4,4,613
so fast oh,0,211,7,7,100
all right greater than symbol,0,55,4,4,696
trying to slow us back down and come back in the right direction towards the space,0,848,10,10,404
were gonna go the optimal path this time alright gonna turn around alright lets gothats not that fast,0,818,1,1,7
i know the recommended strategy was go counterclockwise but if my ship starts going clockwise gonna try to go with it because its so hard to control,0,404,9,9,355
move forward,0,28,2,2,79
forward,0,57,7,7,1232
i keep going out of bounds,0,454,1,1,133
ah come on i had 2 shots left to kill it and i died thats not cool,0,685,8,8,166
okay i didnt expect it to be that hard to control it,0,27,1,1,17
i cant control this its wobbling,0,432,3,3,157
y i dont remember i dont remember he number right now,0,34,7,7,346
ah going too fast cant adjust,0,411,10,10,151
p its just very small movements,0,41,9,9,590
alright this a a,0,16,3,3,230
its like impossible to shoot right,0,3,2,2,32
spin around spin around not fly off,0,14,1,1,473
i just go backwards or left to right i dont know,0,211,7,7,103
okay thats how you move,0,27,1,1,5
definitely the controls though pretty simple game overall,0,818,3,3,37
alright,0,30,2,2,106
turn shoot,0,28,3,3,123
my score is slowly going down,0,804,8,8,373
im not supposed to be flying out of there i lose points,0,20,3,3,508
alright so a mine just destroyed me but i am inside the fortress now traveling at a slow speed and just collected a bonus but then was then shot and destroyed by the fortress,0,848,4,4,292
forward,0,55,10,10,1026
come on lets move out the way alright,0,16,9,9,739
ok q ah man wrong interval too interval was too slow,0,404,4,4,155
decent velocity,0,46,10,10,599
cant slow down,0,46,7,7,506
gotta make sure i stay inside this hexagon,0,54,3,3,348
god he never stops moving,0,20,2,2,431
i think i hot too fast,0,12,1,1,359
oh and hes flying on his own again,0,20,2,2,425
so hopefully this time i can slow my velocity down,0,130,2,2,244
alright a lot more difficult already,0,788,1,1,142
its not very straight forward,0,57,2,2,796
p alright the foe mines are h k and e,0,848,3,3,267
and right before i had it again,0,818,9,9,235
ah i ran into the friendly mine because i was moving too fast,0,3,7,7,130
but i have been trying to do that by not going as fast as possible with the speed controls on the joystick were a little sensitive for mumbles the fortress was at 8 points again unfortunately he was destroyed or i was destroyed so he was unable to be destroyed,0,848,1,1,234
okay seem to be going slow and the slower i go the more velocity points i get,0,34,10,10,481
so its a little faster than that the right click,0,24,2,2,67
sometimes its like harder for me to move it,0,211,6,6,83
slow only forward when you have to,0,300,4,4,299
turn go straight,0,210,10,10,169
im gonna focus on staying in the hexagon,0,300,2,2,272
im not even moving,0,57,4,4,980
im pretty sure oh no it just popped up i didnt have time to get it im going too fast however thats too fast an interval to kill the mine at the mine,0,130,2,2,256
oh yeah alright i see how im a i see how imma duck these things,0,16,3,3,237
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1208
keeping slow this time,0,46,9,9,591
slowly i turn a little,0,57,6,6,1121
p uz and n uz and n uz and n uzn right click interval stupid interval thing i hate that,0,52,7,7,713
when youre moving too fast its probably best to just like let yourself fly off the screen cause then you can like instead of turning around it does it for you basically,0,12,4,4,482
oh jeeze oh my god slow down,0,53,1,1,31
2 hits gotta set myself back up so it moves perfectly,0,372,6,6,74
alright,0,190,1,1,142
slowly drift here,0,14,6,6,695
its moving very fast,0,211,1,1,5
trying to move inch by inch but its so hard to do,0,12,5,5,529
i need to slow down and focus on my 2 shots,0,130,7,7,343
right now i am just trying to stay within the hexagon the best i can while shooting the fortress,0,848,6,6,327
right click,0,52,4,4,592
part of me also feels like when i lean forward it really doesnt do anything,0,57,1,1,760
because i havent really began to come on turn,0,127,9,9,280
all right so try to move,0,12,1,1,350
so theres kind of no thinking going on im just trying to control the thing,0,818,1,1,10
alright,0,14,4,4,585
so the velocity is negative the control is,0,130,2,2,263
flying off this is,0,14,1,1,447
i think i had positive control points so pretty excited about that,0,558,7,7,58
alright alright alright youre not an enemy so you can hit me okay,0,113,9,9,506
stop okay there we go g i think is a bad one and im dead,0,41,1,1,372
you know its like a drunk pilot and it got ahold of the starship enterprise and it just decided to space fortress p is a bad mine i think im gonna shoot that and it turns out that it was,0,41,1,1,384
keep going around clockwise,0,647,3,3,173
going too fast,0,319,6,6,150
straight right straight right straight left left left left,0,20,7,7,660
alright,0,16,4,4,286
p alright,0,24,1,1,47
go around the hexagon,0,57,5,5,1096
alright slow down slow down,0,28,7,7,285
its going real fast,0,647,3,3,172
this is really hard to control,0,26,2,2,15
right now im just trying to fly within the,0,848,10,10,408
i think i got it under control for this one,0,49,6,6,398
but still control is at an alltime minimum,0,558,4,4,22
alright,0,16,7,7,511
i think i got a little bit of control,0,372,1,1,8
its just staying inside this hexagon is the worst part,0,685,5,5,106
when i grew up it was space invaders not something like this,0,127,2,2,214
alright come on where you at,0,16,7,7,527
ok this is the longest ive stayed in the circle so clearly im doing something right when i talk to myself aloud,0,20,7,7,662
because when i barely move vertically it starts shooting at me which makes like a con to moving slowly,0,400,3,3,120
aright,0,16,3,3,194
clockwise right,0,26,2,2,14
its just hard to get back to slow,0,57,2,2,787
alright turn and move,0,16,4,4,276
control,0,57,6,6,1190
and turn shoot,0,28,8,8,346
10 shots left,0,29,6,6,508
your ship wrapped the screen 40 times,0,51,3,3,84
i got a lot of points for staying in the circle,0,12,10,10,692
got a slow speed that works,0,46,10,10,625
im still confused how this thing is still moving its crazy ive been playing this for a while now,0,214,6,6,367
see 3 shots right now thats not good,0,300,9,9,400
alright one  sign,0,20,3,3,478
usually when its closer or go slower i do worse,0,211,6,6,87
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1215
alright,0,16,3,3,207
if i go slow enough,0,55,10,10,1037
no no stop,0,818,8,8,194
i so happen to run okay not really thinking about much right now just thinking about how to slow down,0,41,6,6,501
too fast,0,56,7,7,108
please stop do,0,57,9,9,1389
cbe right click in the interval shoot at it,0,52,8,8,779
too fast sometimes,0,432,1,1,137
its like space galactic,0,49,9,9,458
ok managing to stay in the control zone,0,404,9,9,350
turn around this way yes okay you bounced right off i thought you were going to die,0,818,2,2,32
just get into the hexagon,0,28,1,1,39
alright ydm we got a g,0,16,9,9,689
now im losing control velocity isnt doing to bad,0,34,7,7,359
going too fast going too fast,0,319,8,8,198
alright,0,16,2,2,98
so lets try the original  since the shooting is a little easier sacrifice the velocity needs to slow down a bit,0,848,5,5,308
start out slow,0,300,3,3,281
p alright round two what am i going to do,0,825,1,1,44
also the velocity is a lot harder to control,0,788,2,2,159
sometimes just rotating accelerates you mumbles and then you end up flying everywhere,0,190,10,10,228
it turns so quickly,0,739,2,2,22
i was going to slow mumbles,0,404,10,10,382
alright yes,0,473,3,3,250
slowly,0,28,4,4,173
alright,0,825,10,10,293
just coast right on by,0,818,10,10,271
hyperspace captain,0,53,4,4,174
qcu yeah right,0,52,10,10,884
ok little movements,0,52,3,3,542
control the ship,0,454,5,5,202
fly up and oh thats the ending,0,30,6,6,320
all right weve got the question mark,0,55,3,3,632
