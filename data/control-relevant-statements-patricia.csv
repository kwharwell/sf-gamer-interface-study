p alright im trying to go in the counterclockwise flight path im like having trouble turning it,0,45,1,1,4
alright,0,28,5,5,206
and right before i had it again,0,818,9,9,235
i dont wanna be going this fast,0,14,4,4,548
stops game,0,739,1,1,5
slower and clockwise,0,28,8,8,350
i feel like going slow works the best,0,739,3,3,35
mumbles umm so thats the first dollar sign and thats an enemy mine umm second dollar sign so just trying to stop my acceleration cuz its going too fast,0,130,1,1,230
very hard to control,0,12,8,8,617
p its more harder if you try to stay inside the hexagon,0,658,5,5,39
this is very hard to control,0,29,6,6,502
okay so my control was terrible,0,34,4,4,213
velocity is still too high slow down a tad,0,848,9,9,383
wrapped the screen way too many times,0,319,7,7,187
turn stay,0,20,1,1,409
alright lemmy go my other way,0,16,7,7,537
the plan currently is to try and stay within the fortress as best as possible because the control points are very high,0,848,10,10,407
ok so just moving up and down helps a little,0,411,9,9,131
negative 813 ship was damaged 13 times i was damaged twice by the mines and i screen warped 28 times,0,825,3,3,124
i cant control myself,0,16,3,3,252
slow down,0,51,2,2,24
and i dont know how much times left,0,685,10,10,225
stop stop stop stop stop,0,53,10,10,476
hyperspace,0,818,5,5,108
forward,0,53,10,10,462
were just going to keep going to the right,0,818,5,5,87
i know how to move,0,16,1,1,49
stop running into the tower,0,24,7,7,166
alright its getting a little easier now,0,685,7,7,153
flying towardsthere you go i couldnt even see if it was an ally or not,0,130,8,8,381
alright i definitely just definitely energized that,0,404,1,1,34
the control is real touchy i gotta get used to it,0,681,1,1,189
stop stop,0,411,8,8,115
moving too fast moving too fast moving too fast moving too fast,0,14,4,4,560
dont wrap the screen,0,51,6,6,191
i wont feel right if i dont,0,49,7,7,401
lets see if i can control this thing try to stay in no stay in,0,29,6,6,500
and theres another and im trying to slow down to get inside the thing,0,569,6,6,191
alright this was by far my best run im in the 3000s,0,468,4,4,65
no that was left alright,0,20,7,7,681
p so im trying to go through the circle,0,647,1,1,110
alright this game is impossible,0,20,2,2,441
i cant control it this is really hard to control,0,33,1,1,545
too fast too fast too fast,0,14,4,4,579
im just going in and out of warp zone right now,0,404,3,3,91
p just trying to get the controls down,0,658,4,4,35
no cant control,0,29,3,3,394
uninterpretable yeah if i managed to find a way to control the ship maybe i can do better,0,29,8,8,568
alright this is very sensitive,0,28,2,2,96
vulnerability is at 10 but there was a mine on screen,0,46,8,8,547
so thats an ally mine just trying to move around this hexagon for more control points,0,130,4,4,296
alright,0,20,6,6,601
at least i destroyed it its not fast this is good,0,211,9,9,125
p im trying to get back into the hexagon,0,45,8,8,83
alright vulnerability 2 and he hit me thats enough,0,818,8,8,208
come on stop choking,0,24,8,8,196
stop being so fast,0,54,8,8,422
alright,0,30,2,2,106
okay ill just fly around i guess,0,12,2,2,397
alright thats one,0,16,9,9,722
velocity 42,0,54,5,5,336
im flying counter clockwise im trying to,0,372,1,1,9
alright i just destroyed the fortress so that strategy seems to work,0,372,5,5,64
b alright you my friend,0,16,2,2,144
circles will not get me wins,0,30,5,5,257
alright lets do this,0,319,6,6,141
alright back to zero,0,16,5,5,356
going too fast,0,46,2,2,392
p oh man i was only 4000 points alright,0,558,1,1,7
ok we are going to move slow like this,0,52,2,2,540
nice and slow,0,41,5,5,465
alright,0,28,4,4,165
alright perfect so i think we got the right velocity going,0,848,9,9,384
the mines mumbling cause i couldnt get the ship controlled to save my life,0,804,7,7,327
p okay uhm so i cant slow down,0,50,1,1,3
this is so hard to control,0,131,3,3,65
still cant control this thing,0,26,4,4,52
let me keep moving to escape,0,34,2,2,98
little circles,0,51,6,6,208
alright alright,0,28,2,2,71
i intended to avoid spardic flight pattens,0,12,6,6,551
okay trying to do a counterclockwise thing here,0,41,1,1,322
go forward no forward,0,33,1,1,550
ok uh no ran right into me,0,33,3,3,654
alright that was all ten,0,30,10,10,585
i do not want to be going that fast,0,818,2,2,30
p k g y right,0,50,6,6,66
i must control my movement,0,468,9,9,207
getting out of control first time i see the dollar sign friendly mine also on the screen,0,319,6,6,145
it flies too fast,0,20,6,6,607
slow down going way to fast,0,34,4,4,203
thats confusing how he moves,0,52,1,1,491
esp esp trying to focus on the spaceship while doing the intervals its tough but thats an ally mine luckily,0,130,8,8,377
p i really need to learn to play left handed,0,658,8,8,61
seriously who controlled this,0,41,1,1,309
and im going faster,0,411,6,6,98
alright well just r,0,16,3,3,240
im waiting for the 250 millisecond interval and nothing alright,0,20,4,4,549
especially the maneuverability of it and the dexterity i mean for the to control the spaceship here,0,127,7,7,240
alright slow down,0,16,1,1,19
yeah another im going in circles outside of the lines,0,468,6,6,126
i cant control this is killing me,0,404,1,1,39
hyperspace someone is following me,0,468,8,8,187
i shot too fast that time i can tell,0,12,2,2,392
turn around bang,0,20,8,8,721
please slow down,0,825,4,4,144
who says you need to go in circles to win,0,30,4,4,183
wrong rotation wrong rotation,0,14,5,5,600
alright lets go,0,685,3,3,46
the iff button is the right button but i clicked the left button,0,468,6,6,114
im going to start shooting the fortress slower,0,300,6,6,327
i think its smarter to stay on the outside i feel like im losing more points getting shot than control,0,400,3,3,69
thats a friendly mine but im moving really fast so i dont know if i can shoot it,0,3,7,7,122
so now im consistently shooting the fortress being able to kill it getting used to the ships control more getting used to flying around in a frictionless environment and compensating on the turns,0,681,1,1,218
apparently that friend was a foe so im just gonna keep going into hyperspace apparently since i cant just stay straight,0,804,10,10,406
i got the interval right but i didnt shoot it,0,24,3,3,87
yep fly right into it,0,30,6,6,318
p i feel like its not worth getting the bonuses because i float off so fast,0,18,5,5,36
i cant slow it down come on,0,127,5,5,209
alright beef,0,16,7,7,509
its a lot faster than i thought it was going to,0,647,1,1,111
i hit the left mouse button instead of the right,0,319,3,3,66
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,4,4,310
lets stop lets stop,0,34,8,8,380
inaudible going way too fast but im outside the game ended,0,3,5,5,93
okay thats a foe but my interval wasnt fast enough and bonus,0,49,4,4,360
2 dollar signs bonus points i think that was an enemy mine but he was coming right at me,0,24,6,6,137
well the screen went black,0,33,1,1,577
okay wow were at 7 right now,0,34,5,5,252
alright,0,28,8,8,349
moving slow across from it,0,300,9,9,402
these shots are not controlled at all,0,113,9,9,507
i think im out of control here,0,468,7,7,158
ah interval or speed for my click was too fast and i died,0,685,3,3,62
problem is i just have such a hard time controlling this thing that its hard for me to do anything with it,0,127,7,7,233
go to the left stop it oh wow i ran into that one,0,113,2,2,301
ok i destroyed 1ok much better and im ging slower,0,569,9,9,227
alright,0,49,2,2,308
p alright bonus,0,51,10,10,396
alright theres the bonus 1 bonus 2 for the points,0,404,10,10,385
hmm not fast enough nope,0,568,2,2,47
alright the only way im going to win this is if i have the mine on my side,0,20,4,4,543
i seem to be losing a lot of control points,0,34,5,5,250
that doesnt stop moving,0,20,1,1,393
slow again,0,300,4,4,273
p yes thats what im trying to concentrate on right now,0,432,3,3,125
its very hard to get any control points or velocity points,0,12,1,1,365
turn,0,28,1,1,28
alright,0,16,7,7,575
now im gonna start focusing on i guess that well staying in the control zone,0,404,10,10,368
slow down,0,27,6,6,113
so yeah just trying to understand the movement and get the muscle memory down because it might take some time,0,468,3,3,42
so i got one more hit left,0,34,6,6,313
okay no stop stop moving,0,113,5,5,378
okay gained some control there we go,0,818,6,6,129
im started to go too fast at that,0,12,8,8,616
going too fast i see the dollar sign and an enemy mine,0,319,7,7,168
ok ok ok i got it under control now,0,155,6,6,236
alright im only on the ten point,0,16,8,8,656
alright this is way more,0,825,1,1,4
all right thats an enemy mine,0,55,7,7,811
turn,0,28,6,6,271
no stop leaving the screen,0,113,2,2,286
okay its really difficult to speak and talk at the same time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 i guess i guess it shoots you quickly you slow down,0,41,7,7,528
i can slow down when i get killed but id prefer to do that differently,0,569,5,5,176
okay vulnerability is at 0 which is bad cuz i get a turn on this,0,29,6,6,497
alright,0,28,1,1,19
stop corning me,0,113,3,3,318
its honestly its better to just stay still because of all of these points im losing from the hexagon,0,54,4,4,257
just stay in the circle,0,51,4,4,103
turn turn turn,0,127,2,2,149
run forward,0,30,8,8,443
im really just trying to get this thing to like allow me to control it but were not friends right now,0,47,1,1,8
i gotta build up the vulnerability counter and try to move clockwise,0,681,1,1,194
its not staying on the lines right now,0,46,1,1,362
yep dont even know where clockwise is now,0,57,3,3,968
p oh friend or foe mouse right counterclockwise got it,0,53,2,2,39
p slow down,0,50,4,4,46
alright here we go,0,28,6,6,248
alright where the next motherfworder at,0,16,7,7,580
aww now its real fast oh crap,0,211,7,7,92
p lyv this is whether or not a mine is a foe so if it shows up on the iff counter at the bottom of the screen i have to if its one of those letters then it is a foe,0,681,1,1,188
going into hyperspace,0,468,9,9,198
all right full game,0,57,4,4,1037
but due to my incredible maneuvering i cannot seem to line up a shot and the one time i do i seem to click it too rapidly which resets the vulnerability score so it is very frustrating,0,558,2,2,12
my left hand cant respond to nothin,0,16,4,4,293
so its a little faster than that the right click,0,24,2,2,67
p yeah this thing is moving so fast its hard to pay attention to the mines and dollar signs but i know i should,0,211,2,2,33
and just went to hyper space,0,14,7,7,720
octagon,0,41,1,1,336
i pressed space bar by accident,0,113,1,1,246
i think i had positive control points so pretty excited about that,0,558,7,7,58
oh im still like flying around,0,214,2,2,213
alright okay okay,0,28,5,5,200
i was gonna fly strait at it,0,14,8,8,770
aright,0,16,8,8,650
thats weird i didnt notice the fortress was spinning within the octagon or hexagon whatever,0,211,5,5,69
ok now start trying to control a little bit more,0,404,8,8,306
uhh alright,0,825,4,4,151
oh no wait oh the mine is on the screen,0,190,1,1,113
its crazy alright,0,113,2,2,308
alright so bouncing off the middle seems to send me in the opposite direction so its not a good way to slow me down,0,468,8,8,178
the whole having to move forward to move yoursledf back is a lot to manage,0,400,4,4,88
turn turn,0,210,4,4,46
i got the right interval and was able to shoot it to get another vulnerability point on the  oh i did horrible,0,848,9,9,393
alright,0,818,5,5,106
slowing down im staying better now,0,300,3,3,258
too fast slow down,0,300,3,3,252
alright so,0,568,1,1,8
p yeah do i press space bar,0,568,1,1,29
go straight make a left,0,20,7,7,655
sorry didnt fly it,0,53,2,2,50
i think oh didnt happen this time alright,0,558,3,3,16
alright,0,28,5,5,228
alright so i need to stay within the hexagon,0,52,1,1,488
going too fast,0,319,6,6,150
getting a little more control but unintelligible im not going to be doing so hot,0,804,6,6,306
alright i might as well just use my shit,0,16,4,4,296
turn,0,28,4,4,189
i think the next time i play this game its going to switch the controls on me,0,53,1,1,32
im too strong with the thrust,0,16,9,9,693
alright thats it,0,16,8,8,635
too fast aww i got to pay attention to that,0,211,6,6,81
p so this is nothing right here txh,0,26,1,1,3
oh alright so the hardest thing is not making any huge movements,0,319,2,2,19
p im going to go over the instructions so i have 2 left click when i see the dollar sign right click when i see the number,0,52,10,10,851
oooh slow down slow down slow down,0,127,6,6,219
so fast oh,0,211,7,7,100
i was going to slow mumbles,0,404,10,10,382
lemmy try to slow this down,0,29,2,2,363
alright i have control now,0,825,8,8,245
just get into the hexagon,0,28,1,1,39
p ok i cannot play this game right its kind of embarrassing,0,411,2,2,28
fly up and oh thats the ending,0,30,6,6,320
p alright,0,454,4,4,191
l alright you my dog,0,16,8,8,641
alright,0,404,5,5,177
p alright i got one more shot,0,16,10,10,754
alright well destroyed the fortress once time,0,404,8,8,327
ok hes at 10 now ah man alright if i could just not mess this up i can actually manage to,0,404,5,5,189
slow oh alright,0,30,3,3,143
alright so now we have this game plan set up,0,848,9,9,388
i cant get a control of it,0,210,1,1,5
its kind of hard to keep out of hyperspace but oh the boss got me,0,804,2,2,247
but if i move too fast ill lose control,0,404,1,1,42
right we got some type of points,0,57,9,9,1403
okay well velocity isnt doing too bad just the points right now which is,0,34,7,7,351
alright this oh oh,0,20,4,4,513
i didnt expect it to have all this moving stuff,0,217,1,1,35
p yeah like sometimes its like harder to move around i dont think its the controls,0,211,6,6,84
oh this is really alright,0,568,1,1,6
turning,0,28,6,6,242
slow down,0,51,7,7,235
alright,0,28,1,1,34
okay there we go alright lets go,0,685,5,5,111
difficulty staying in the hexagon,0,432,2,2,114
pit stopped,0,40,1,1,47
um just flying it not really changing anything,0,33,6,6,763
uhh yeah okay so same controls,0,53,4,4,142
alright,0,16,2,2,141
i m choosing not to shoot right now because i dont have any bullets and i dont want to take negative points as im already doing,0,685,4,4,88
slowing down,0,300,5,5,313
oh i couldve gotten it no it was b so i had to turn it into a,0,52,5,5,666
so i want to turn him into a friendy,0,52,1,1,523
slowed down too much,0,3,6,6,112
alright,0,404,2,2,72
slowing down is extremely  difficult so its better to go at an optimal speed constantly or just very slow constatntly,0,12,2,2,398
ok so not going clockwise but im gonna try to stay in the middle kinda not go to hyperspace like the last few rounds,0,468,6,6,133
alright but i didnt get hit as much,0,16,4,4,341
turn and no,0,28,7,7,301
alright best score yet,0,558,7,7,57
p when theres nothing in the screen i can fore at the fortress,0,52,8,8,782
theres no slowing down,0,49,1,1,254
p i like how fast this game is,0,432,1,1,101
all right,0,55,4,4,659
my turning will never start off strong,0,16,7,7,514
and we have 14 left,0,848,6,6,324
sometimes its like harder for me to move it,0,211,6,6,83
alright there we go,0,51,4,4,93
turn around,0,55,3,3,627
p but i feel like im starting to get the hang of it a little bit except that the joystick is very sensitive so i keep flying all over the place,0,45,1,1,7
umm its still i think the hardest thing is identifying the bonuses cuz you have so much on the screen,0,685,7,7,159
alright,0,16,1,1,44
mine on the screen k,0,55,6,6,785
its not fair it just gets you right when you start,0,473,3,3,202
tba that means i have to turn it,0,52,6,6,714
one bonus achieved still getting used to the controls since the ship does not slow down,0,804,3,3,259
im trying to not be crazy all over the screen for once,0,569,4,4,151
um i stay outside the control zone,0,404,4,4,169
alright try to keep going in a counterclockwise shape,0,28,3,3,125
too slowly there,0,404,7,7,250
alright he got me,0,190,3,3,159
trying to slow myself down before i shoot,0,300,9,9,394
total score is 3890 and wrapped the screen 57 times,0,52,1,1,524
alright lets ride,0,16,9,9,731
alright,0,54,6,6,365
alright lets do this,0,319,8,8,192
strategy of just flying randomly,0,30,3,3,139
dang my left hand cant respond for shit,0,16,8,8,661
all right there,0,55,5,5,723
i feel like its not the best strategy because every time i go off the screen its 75 on the control but i thought i would get points better that way but it has not been working out quite,0,848,2,2,223
its hard to control this the same way you control a space ship,0,647,6,6,188
every time i warp my control gets worse,0,33,4,4,679
i am tired of your mess this is annoying you are annoying you are annoying you little backwards e,0,113,7,7,454
alright i think thats the second dollar sign,0,473,6,6,288
so close slow down,0,825,4,4,143
alrighty continue,0,41,2,2,378
alright get outta here,0,16,2,2,154
p slow down,0,50,9,9,111
i shouldve mumbles wrapped around the screen thirtyfour times,0,55,2,2,616
definitely the controls though pretty simple game overall,0,818,3,3,37
ok trying to stay back in control,0,404,4,4,164
so right now im just trying to shoot at it,0,130,2,2,253
p its hard to move,0,211,2,2,19
alright i got it,0,454,2,2,162
it is so hard to stay in bounds,0,16,1,1,54
okay alright the flight is getting a little better,0,113,6,6,414
i just go backwards or left to right i dont know,0,211,7,7,103
alright this a a,0,16,3,3,230
yeah its real easy to spin out of control,0,400,5,5,102
gonna wrap around im going too fast too fast too fast enemy mine,0,319,3,3,57
come on turn turn turn,0,127,8,8,256
turn,0,28,3,3,141
too fast,0,12,6,6,563
whoa too fast,0,788,3,3,85
p oh it said it right there so,0,33,1,1,569
i can just keep this going so what im doing now is just sliding on the screen taking advantage of the little to no friction on the ground and then it appears the fortress cannot shoot me,0,848,2,2,217
i dont care if i keep going into hyperspace i just need to get this vulnerability,0,34,3,3,147
ok thats off to a bad start already slow it down,0,468,7,7,146
im circling,0,468,8,8,182
alright this is a lot harder than i thought it would be,0,28,1,1,45
nice and slow 6 7 8 wait thats a good mine k bonus points,0,41,10,10,621
i dint see the interval i think it was too fast,0,24,8,8,176
p this thing is fast,0,40,1,1,46
p im trying to go slow and clockwise,0,50,1,1,9
oh i gotta slow down,0,34,2,2,65
oh right click bonus points,0,52,4,4,637
just stay slow,0,28,4,4,168
oh no thats clockwise,0,57,5,5,1127
trying to stay in control mumbles,0,809,6,6,101
it feels like if you go off the screen it makes you real faster,0,513,2,2,40
i have 4 shot left,0,41,3,3,399
p alright,0,404,8,8,281
im having a hard time controlling the ship,0,809,1,1,15
umm that hyperspace word makes me want to watch that movie with owen wilson,0,53,3,3,125
aright um just going to come her and shoot for now,0,54,6,6,351
youre a friend yay i guess right,0,113,8,8,476
turn and move,0,28,10,10,417
alright,0,24,3,3,85
now im losing control velocity isnt doing to bad,0,34,7,7,359
alright,0,54,8,8,430
gotts stick and move stick and move,0,16,5,5,432
im out of control i see a dollar sign its the first time though second time,0,319,5,5,117
too fast,0,131,2,2,49
alright now lets try shooting at some stuff,0,28,1,1,38
alright ill try to at least destroy the fortress at least once if i hit it,0,804,4,4,272
i just realized that i have 15 shots alright then,0,558,8,8,62
moving forward again vulnerability is still at 0,0,300,3,3,248
you can only focus on one thing either destroying the mine or the fortress and then theres things shooting at you and then you have to think about not going into hyperdrive or hyperspace and the points and i dont even look at the points at times,0,53,7,7,310
enemy mine going way too fast,0,319,5,5,124
ive been getting the most points for control really,0,12,5,5,536
its so risky to slow down,0,12,2,2,406
especially i think the hardest thing for me right now is figuring out what to like after i gain speed,0,468,2,2,20
alright alright stop,0,113,2,2,297
straight left,0,20,7,7,658
okay stop stop it oh crap this crap i dont know what that was so i just flew away that works,0,113,4,4,365
ive lost control right now,0,34,10,10,469
its almost impossible to go slow,0,24,1,1,20
alright,0,404,8,8,288
so keep turn forward too much too much,0,28,2,2,100
if i do the right math wait points matter two,0,825,10,10,302
and again i noticed i have negative  oh cool i got bullets right when i said that,0,190,10,10,230
so for now once we get back in this hexagon we can start spinning counterclockwise because for some reason the tower does not seem to like to shoot when you are going around counterclockwise than if you stay on one specific side,0,848,4,4,260
slow gotta keep going slow,0,52,2,2,548
slow down no,0,569,10,10,242
alright so mumbles oh yeah i dont know what you are i dont know you,0,113,2,2,293
alright alright alright who are you what are you,0,113,6,6,434
ugh im out of control again,0,809,4,4,67
alright so its supposed to be a long wait then,0,16,9,9,745
im gonna try to slow down 10 vulnerability counter is there,0,41,2,2,348
slow down,0,12,9,9,663
alright umm no no no okay just gotta ive still yet to get any bonus points or anything,0,685,1,1,19
keep hitting back on the control pad in order to stop the motion but i realize that it doesnt,0,404,2,2,77
the spaceship is trying to,0,130,5,5,324
all right so take maneuver around,0,55,1,1,546
i had the flight plan down but yeah it took a long time,0,20,10,10,810
p center joystick top bottom thats right,0,53,3,3,93
im gonna try to move in a straight line and shoot instead,0,300,6,6,333
okay i didnt expect it to be that hard to control it,0,27,1,1,17
there may be a way i can make it slow down then,0,52,2,2,530
p stop bumping into the fortress,0,50,8,8,87
if you go super slow you make yourself vulnerable to the fortress and the mines,0,12,1,1,366
alright,0,16,5,5,359
p alright lets get it,0,16,1,1,6
usually i can get a couple of shots in without having to move too much cuz its only when i move that really messes me up,0,24,4,4,97
going too fast going too fast,0,319,7,7,186
shooting too fast thats a friendly mine,0,404,2,2,73
alright,0,28,2,2,102
alright,0,16,2,2,98
alright so its kind of like a point and then alright,0,214,1,1,197
i need to slow down slow down a bit before i fire,0,300,8,8,377
thats what i want i gotta slow down my ship here so i can shoot this thing and im dead cuz of course okay,0,41,2,2,370
alright,0,16,3,3,185
alright,0,28,9,9,385
slow myself down first,0,300,10,10,409
oh no i cant move,0,130,10,10,417
the more i see my points to 2000 the more i shoot faster,0,569,6,6,184
alright that makes sense only way to apply thrust is to pick direction you want then hit forward,0,977,1,1,55
p just bouncing off the fortress right now,0,50,2,2,17
then the next one comes moves way too easily,0,34,6,6,292
alright thats a more comfortable speed,0,647,1,1,128
6 7 im actually not doing that bad right now 8 thats a good mine 9 10 there we go,0,41,10,10,630
alright,0,825,7,7,213
alright i still got my points,0,16,9,9,730
it helps if i screen wrap but i know that messes with points oh see went to fast there,0,404,6,6,220
turn around,0,55,9,9,980
this is fine just going in circles at this point,0,113,5,5,391
slow down there,0,12,4,4,473
slow down,0,51,10,10,422
ok q ah man wrong interval too interval was too slow,0,404,4,4,155
p no like when i wrap the screen,0,211,7,7,102
whoever designed these controls really needs to work on this,0,41,1,1,295
this is really hard to control,0,26,2,2,15
alright,0,54,5,5,290
p over time i havent gotten better at controlling this thing,0,400,7,7,117
right now the fortress has 7 vulnerability,0,848,6,6,316
just trying to get control of the game,0,404,1,1,19
oh i shot to fast,0,34,4,4,211
too slow on my interval,0,41,6,6,490
i dont feel like im in control,0,210,2,2,24
alright,0,16,7,7,511
there was just the first dollar sign but that was  im still circling the fortress trying to get the best shot without getting hit,0,848,7,7,341
otherwise if i keep going in the circle i can make it to a positive score,0,400,6,6,113
i could use that as a way to stop me,0,34,2,2,82
alright ok oh my god,0,214,1,1,179
space,0,14,2,2,460
that mine appeared right where i was,0,41,3,3,383
i just want to be more competent with my left,0,53,4,4,157
is there a way to slow down,0,38,1,1,176
p this is too fast,0,127,1,1,120
yep alright,0,30,7,7,370
the other way the other way seems to be turning out better for me,0,57,7,7,1298
alright im gonna do this,0,404,7,7,245
oh enemy popped up right in my face,0,319,2,2,41
so im staying my main strategy right now is to avoid the mine and im not staying in the hexagon very much because im trying to as much as i can but its hard,0,685,6,6,134
okay no control,0,818,6,6,128
nice and slow,0,41,10,10,633
slow down,0,57,3,3,1010
80 shots left no,0,29,4,4,442
turn and slow down,0,28,3,3,136
okay were back inside the hexagon,0,34,7,7,355
p oh right,0,3,1,1,8
trying to focus to shoot it instead of staying inside the hexagon this time,0,300,4,4,282
try to rotate,0,300,8,8,379
flying backwards,0,30,9,9,515
oh i just oh thats right because it totals all the scores,0,12,5,5,535
getting out of control,0,319,4,4,100
rotate right,0,300,1,1,208
going too fast,0,848,4,4,259
2 im moving out of control for a second here,0,14,7,7,700
alright just keep going this flight plan is not working at all,0,113,2,2,285
alright 1 now im going the other way,0,825,8,8,249
p ok my question is i might just not umm been hitting the enemy fortress but once i got to ten i was trying to hit it with two shots and uh it seemed to be going right through it,0,404,5,5,192
go forward,0,20,8,8,723
albright there is one,0,54,4,4,266
okay back in control,0,818,5,5,118
when the ship starts too fast youre screwed the whole game cuz then youre gloating around like on ice skates,0,977,4,4,77
whatever im gonna okay i dont care if i go out of bounds,0,16,1,1,58
p its better not to move i feel like haha,0,18,2,2,29
alright alright alright,0,404,6,6,240
alright i gotta turn than move,0,16,6,6,445
alright bonus 2 my shots are at 53 so my next bonus im going to get bullets oh no i clicked too early dang it,0,130,9,9,409
too close to the edge,0,14,2,2,471
p  ok same controls,0,53,5,5,194
alright,0,16,5,5,406
get away from me personal space,0,53,10,10,495
p ok so im trying to control the uh ship and im playing the joystick controls not very well,0,468,1,1,3
alright definitely not getting the once youre staying in lines,0,468,1,1,13
alright im not doing as well though,0,190,4,4,175
alright slow down slow down,0,28,7,7,285
its must easier to just circle it,0,12,10,10,677
i cant never remember how fast i did these shoots,0,16,6,6,487
p ok ok thats right,0,411,1,1,4
i got way too fast on the speed,0,49,3,3,340
alright so another  sign so weapons,0,20,3,3,495
alright i really want to get the flight path down,0,20,3,3,498
p alright are people usually this bad,0,20,2,2,419
and i lost control,0,788,10,10,191
p ytn alright,0,41,8,8,541
laughs alright,0,190,1,1,112
its moving very fast,0,211,1,1,5
slow down,0,127,6,6,223
hyperspace my own element mumbles,0,468,7,7,150
im still completely out of control,0,468,4,4,61
aright,0,16,3,3,194
to the right,0,818,6,6,121
yep alright okay cool,0,30,8,8,418
ok keep it slow i see ok,0,52,2,2,544
alright,0,319,1,1,8
too fast,0,14,3,3,533
slow down,0,51,7,7,255
slow down slow down,0,411,5,5,73
oh wait i think thats right,0,28,4,4,158
right oh lord,0,24,1,1,17
alright ydm we got a g,0,16,9,9,689
okay no turn that way good yes okay now you left the screen so alright back right who are you,0,113,4,4,352
so right now im still trying my best to stay within the hexagon which has been proven better for me at this game,0,848,7,7,340
stop hitting me,0,29,1,1,331
wait i have to shh i have to turn it into no if its tba that means its,0,52,6,6,719
and slow down,0,28,8,8,344
dang turn turn turn turn dang,0,16,5,5,375
so now im just going to try to fly around and avoid everything so i can get shots,0,685,9,9,198
p okay turn come on,0,127,6,6,215
cant shoot it too fast thats a friendly mine,0,404,2,2,75
lets do this right,0,432,8,8,175
p alright,0,848,5,5,275
so dont go too fast stay in the lines theres a dollar sign it disappeared,0,468,6,6,104
ah just when i gained control again,0,155,10,10,299
alright i dont know who designed this game but its so hard,0,51,3,3,60
so right about now i am thinking i kind of want to be ambidextrous,0,53,4,4,151
now little better on this control thing,0,28,5,5,216
alright,0,26,3,3,21
turn turn,0,28,10,10,446
im not just taking hits anytime you move just strait at the fortress youre just done for,0,14,9,9,810
p im getting the interval too fast and i know im doing it too fast whenever i do it its just a habit of clicking it as fast as i can instead of thinking of the time,0,685,6,6,129
spin around and lose control,0,818,8,8,203
2 hits gotta set myself back up so it moves perfectly,0,372,6,6,74
alright,0,43,9,9,195
one personal space,0,53,6,6,265
it is not indicative of my performance uninterpretable alright i regressed,0,41,3,3,408
its not moving,0,788,10,10,182
i need to learn how to control my velocity,0,51,2,2,34
alright i which is an enemy mine,0,404,3,3,111
okay clockwise not too fast i could probably do a lot better with my right hand but yes shoot it,0,818,2,2,18
alright,0,825,1,1,11
turn,0,56,2,2,26
so why doesnt it go faster,0,33,7,7,818
frictionless is right,0,411,1,1,5
p controls,0,14,9,9,776
there you go slow and steady but,0,41,7,7,511
im just going to stay at the bottom of the screen,0,113,7,7,458
p i am not knowing how to control this,0,568,1,1,11
oh man so theres no way of slowing it down,0,211,3,3,39
i havent really been able to control much,0,848,1,1,199
alright come on come on come on come on,0,16,6,6,460
their processing speed is just so fast and their fire rate is insane,0,211,8,8,111
alright,0,319,2,2,18
turn,0,51,5,5,163
st 7 right now,0,46,5,5,458
okay turn and he got me,0,57,2,2,918
im in hyperspace getting followed by a mine which is definitely foe,0,468,6,6,111
im going too fast im out of control but we can fix that,0,319,9,9,215
turn then move,0,16,6,6,499
also moving the ship is kinda wonky it like requires you to turn it and accelerate it but the bad guy moves so much faster than you that its kinda hard to get a grip,0,411,9,9,140
alright this,0,16,9,9,748
alright alright there we go something is happening,0,113,2,2,287
but i just keep hitting the spaceship,0,130,2,2,247
i am getting close to 1200 so thats my goal right now,0,558,8,8,63
this is just alright this is just how imma do it,0,16,3,3,239
too close to the edge,0,14,2,2,470
trying to make it stay like in the hexagon but i want to go in the,0,52,1,1,511
go forward,0,51,5,5,169
turn around turn around turn around,0,127,8,8,248
every time i see tba i have to turn into i have to right click twice to turn into a friendly mine,0,52,6,6,704
slow down,0,12,4,4,476
like if youre going really fast in one direction just turn around to the opposite and then yeah and then just accelerate in that direction and um that definitely helps a lot cause now i can kind of like keep myself from flying off the,0,214,3,3,260
alright just gonna focus on sp velocity,0,28,3,3,130
ship is going too fast,0,130,3,3,275
alright,0,16,2,2,119
alright,0,26,5,5,67
all right,0,57,1,1,862
alright so instructions,0,16,4,4,265
alright,0,28,4,4,179
now i gotta remember to look down at the bottom of the screen,0,568,2,2,39
let me just keep going to the right,0,818,8,8,209
that thing follows me fast,0,51,3,3,71
im trying to go right and its not working,0,20,1,1,404
ok so i feel more in control of my actions and less of like i dont know whats going on but still trying to stay inside the lines,0,468,3,3,33
lets see yes i see my control,0,33,4,4,678
i really dont want this guy to go off the screen but he keeps wanting to do that,0,47,5,5,65
got him and died right away,0,647,7,7,205
if i could slow down and not fly over the screen,0,569,5,5,172
nice double tap slow down,0,910,8,8,191
p i keep flying outside of the hexagon which is making me lose points which isnt good,0,45,2,2,12
alright go forward,0,20,5,5,574
going forward rotating towards the fortress firing ok firing and then toward or again,0,300,1,1,201
okay keep going going to the right and not get hit,0,818,8,8,196
its mhc here right now,0,404,8,8,326
it turns so quickly,0,739,2,2,22
i got that come on slow down,0,29,4,4,430
alright,0,372,9,9,114
p uninterpretable 410 alright so i press continue,0,16,1,1,87
i can turn that into a nope its gone,0,52,6,6,709
yea your ship was damaged 13 times and screen wrapped around less than last time,0,53,3,3,133
turn,0,127,8,8,255
go right,0,20,7,7,654
and then the velocity and control are awful but that another time to deal with that,0,29,5,5,478
yeah definitely going too fast,0,468,3,3,41
alright mine down,0,28,5,5,213
okay alright okay stop exiting the screen keep turning okay i bounced off of that i dont know if thats friendly or not,0,113,2,2,283
i need control of this,0,647,8,8,217
i cant control a thing,0,155,1,1,139
it seems i do a little better going counterclockwise round instead of clockwise,0,558,4,4,20
oh im in a hexagon,0,52,5,5,663
p gotta slow down gotta slow down thats foe,0,50,8,8,96
ok so from the starting point if you just hit up you are able to uh stay out of direct path flight which  trying to fly back up alright so now we can spin through the screen,0,848,9,9,380
alright this was my work on my speed a little and i can start from there,0,49,5,5,379
using the joystick with my left hand,0,53,4,4,162
p okay so i think the main thing is to try to not get into hyperspace,0,468,1,1,10
p okay its pretty hard just feel like umm just doing this with my left hand is pretty difficult,0,319,1,1,5
p thats a lot harder than i thought it would be i didnt think it would be that sensitive to the touch and everything and your first instinct is to back thrust and you cant do that though to slow down or anything so,0,685,1,1,22
alright,0,404,7,7,247
p alright this time im finishing positive,0,16,5,5,345
going too fast going too fast,0,319,8,8,198
trying to slow down,0,3,6,6,111
out of control,0,319,5,5,136
hopefully ill destroy it 6 times im moving much slower than last time,0,825,10,10,288
and um im finding that if you start off in the hexagon and you move so like if youre going along the hexagon you just shift right there points to screen at the perfect timing you know,0,214,5,5,307
i think its actually impossible to fly in the circle,0,3,1,1,18
trying the same strategy keep moving around,0,372,6,6,73
im trying to slow down,0,12,8,8,620
the closer i get to it the control zone is very hard to stay in because i get hit pretty fast,0,404,4,4,160
alright,0,28,10,10,439
my reaction time is a little bit slower cause i have to look at the ifs thing remember what the letters were and then shoot at it,0,411,7,7,107
i lost control,0,818,5,5,117
going around the circle is not working for me,0,46,6,6,481
alright cool,0,190,3,3,170
ok so i have 68 shots left,0,54,5,5,305
this round i was able to keep control positive but everything else is still negative,0,848,4,4,270
p it seems like purposely running into the fortress can be a good idea because then you dont run out of bounds,0,513,4,4,58
so this is right this is left this is straight,0,20,7,7,649
there is a mine on the screen which is an l,0,848,9,9,392
i cant  no stop stop,0,113,1,1,241
i really dont know how to slow down and i cant seem to aim really at all,0,558,1,1,4
space fortress is mumbles enemy mine,0,319,7,7,175
p i know the objective is to keep going around in circles like that but i just cant control it well enough at this point to do that so,0,127,4,4,178
and i still cant control this ship because it has a mind of its own,0,20,1,1,399
uh how does it expect you to stay within the circle,0,825,3,3,101
avoid getting shot trying to go a little slower,0,24,1,1,19
alright gotcha gotcha gotcha,0,214,8,8,348
alright so were staying on the same side got shot once unfortunately the space ship is spinning out of control and i got shot and died again,0,848,5,5,286
alright oh n is enemy they move very fast by the time i look down and register hes almost on top of me,0,404,6,6,219
there you go oh no too fast,0,130,6,6,335
uggghhh go forward,0,30,3,3,133
alright,0,28,2,2,88
going too fast around this,0,46,2,2,379
slow down,0,51,6,6,211
trying to do this with my left hand is definitely hindering my point game,0,818,3,3,38
oh alright then i have to pay attention i have to pay attention to that a little bit more,0,825,4,4,139
p yeah umm i wrapped the screen 32 times definitely better upgrade,0,568,2,2,53
no were off into hyperspace,0,818,4,4,81
i dont know why they turn to asteroids,0,24,10,10,231
im moving in a square again,0,300,6,6,320
alright,0,127,7,7,236
its very slippery im staying outside of the control line a lot which is very difficult to stay in and when it starts immediately and the fortress gets off the first shot that i really cannot avoid,0,404,1,1,21
p alright,0,20,3,3,465
gonna learn how to move,0,16,8,8,655
p alright,0,848,1,1,211
mmm if i go too fast it doesnt even shoot at me so thats good,0,404,10,10,384
alright umm the vulnerability is still at 0 so i cannot attack the fortress,0,372,1,1,15
slowing down making sure i stay in the hexagon this time,0,300,9,9,403
alright,0,16,3,3,219
so with the mines its better to shoot them right away then check while youre shooting to see whether or not theyre enemy or friendly and if they are enemy then take down the defenses and if theyre friendly you already shot them,0,681,6,6,285
alright,0,319,4,4,79
p xfp alright okay and already entered hyperspace,0,41,1,1,292
oh i can ic an even fire at ait i can literally be firing at it right now,0,52,8,8,794
p clockwise,0,432,8,8,184
an enemy and a bonus but aw man that was really fast,0,130,9,9,408
p its fast,0,40,1,1,49
come on turn around,0,55,10,10,1027
p yeah like between right there and where you spawn,0,211,4,4,50
alright come on lets go,0,568,2,2,40
trying to stay inside the hexagon while shooting it,0,130,5,5,316
ok so im definitely not in control right now,0,468,3,3,37
not doing too entirely bad this game yet so far but what im trying to do is stay in the hexagon the best that i can the fortess,0,848,3,3,234
i got to slow down thats what i need to do,0,54,9,9,446
alright three minutes its done,0,53,10,10,498
just fly up fly up,0,30,9,9,495
alright destroyed the fortress i have positive points finally i got 310,0,372,8,8,99
completely forgot the controls for a second,0,14,2,2,478
once you lose control its very hard to get it back,0,12,7,7,577
ah turn turn turn turn  mumbling,0,210,4,4,43
pretty in control with this o thats a friendly mine oh man i hit the wrong button,0,404,5,5,178
okay alright,0,825,2,2,56
im not even staying in the circle,0,51,3,3,63
im not losing points for going to hyperspace but mumbles,0,468,4,4,48
no i had 10 velocity,0,34,9,9,414
i mean im always in hyperspace anyway,0,53,8,8,367
alright turn and move,0,16,4,4,276
i guess it kind of says down if you turn the way that you wanna go,0,57,2,2,889
alright come on where you at,0,16,7,7,527
to the left,0,56,1,1,11
press rotate,0,300,8,8,383
this hexagon oh man,0,130,5,5,325
swipe right,0,27,1,1,19
got to slow down,0,52,3,3,562
turn,0,28,2,2,80
as long as im moving ever so slightly i should umm,0,24,3,3,84
oh no too fast too fast,0,818,4,4,75
dont move,0,12,4,4,497
i just wish i could use my right hand,0,53,2,2,60
i stopped caring whether or not i stay in the hexagon,0,400,2,2,62
mumbles instructions on screen,0,33,2,2,583
right now it is already back to 3,0,848,5,5,294
wait slow slow,0,53,3,3,123
accelerating left,0,910,3,3,82
alright no calm okay yes,0,113,4,4,350
just moving up and down,0,411,9,9,133
p i just dont remember if its right,0,3,3,3,56
okay were positive right now,0,34,4,4,163
im actually gaining hits on this thing ill get no control points but i think i can take the hit honestly how this game is so hard to control,0,404,2,2,83
im moving around shooting at him im almost at 10,0,300,4,4,291
p its just really hard to control right now,0,27,1,1,6
it goes really fast,0,3,1,1,9
p im trying to go in the counterclockwise pathway but im struggling a little bit,0,45,1,1,5
alright destroyed the fortress twice getting better at it now,0,809,3,3,63
alright,0,127,2,2,155
i almost died but i got it and i only have 136 points right now so im doing a lot better than ive been doing,0,685,7,7,157
p alright,0,127,2,2,146
at this point just trying to get used to the controls and not fly off in some random direction,0,14,1,1,437
going too fast going too fast,0,319,8,8,208
its hard to stay inside the hexagon,0,809,1,1,22
stop moving so fast slow down slow down,0,16,8,8,616
n 5 5 velocity,0,41,9,9,601
alright,0,16,4,4,336
alright oh gotta keep moving,0,28,5,5,223
trying to get a hang of the controls first,0,681,1,1,204
keep trying to shoot too fast as well,0,12,3,3,439
okay stop leaving the screen no no,0,113,4,4,348
slow down,0,51,4,4,92
slow down,0,454,10,10,252
alright k thats friendly,0,404,8,8,320
okay so how do i slow down again,0,57,9,9,1422
alright lets get this party stared,0,54,5,5,292
take it slow down i do dont something,0,52,1,1,499
going too fast,0,319,7,7,184
alright what this is,0,16,5,5,376
ok i got 3 vulnerability points not flying out control yet,0,809,3,3,51
no cant control,0,210,6,6,88
not even using the mouse right now,0,404,2,2,69
so my screen warping is getting well better,0,825,3,3,125
i kind of assumed that if i move my ship to the right that it would automatically go on a trail to the hold on like to the right but it does not,0,558,2,2,10
okay so for this one im just going to try and wrap the screen as many times as possible and just shoot when i have the opportunity,0,372,5,5,58
p yeah that seems to be the best course here cause trying to go in a circle like it wants me to is just kinda frustrating,0,411,10,10,145
control was significantly worse,0,3,4,4,75
since whenever you move in ac ertain direction you keep moving in that direction,0,12,5,5,522
no no cause the spacebar doesnt do anything,0,52,1,1,496
nope mumbles alright,0,739,10,10,102
alright,0,788,3,3,84
slow your speed,0,51,6,6,180
keep moving keep moving keep moving,0,14,4,4,554
mumbles i dont know why i stopped there,0,300,9,9,391
uh im moving backwards,0,3,6,6,96
this is too much this is too much stop stop stop,0,113,1,1,243
okay if i just slow down somehow,0,57,3,3,1008
at 5 vulnerability friendly mine right there,0,319,2,2,29
p well i can see this is a large difference from my first trial because before i couldnt get the thing to stay on the screen,0,190,9,9,215
p youre right,0,3,3,3,53
im gunna try something different im gunna try a fly by tactic,0,910,2,2,36
please stop shooting me,0,41,7,7,520
okay move there we go,0,910,2,2,40
one personal space,0,53,6,6,256
now im out of control again,0,809,2,2,41
alright cool,0,28,8,8,359
yup turn then move,0,16,6,6,446
just keep on moving thats one dollar sign,0,14,9,9,790
okay out of space here,0,41,1,1,327
slightly better but my points on velocity and control arent great,0,46,8,8,570
okay seem to be going slow and the slower i go the more velocity points i get,0,34,10,10,481
one thing i noticed is it shoots you right as soon as you start so you start with negative points,0,685,5,5,96
its just that nothing really comes to mind other than trying to move,0,910,1,1,14
slow down,0,51,6,6,217
and ive noticed that the fortress doesnt shoot until it has you stopped somewhere you know so if you move or if you like mumbling,0,214,6,6,323
alright i got 1500 points more this time really excited,0,558,2,2,13
p i keep pulling it backwards but it doesnt work,0,50,2,2,18
new zoom velocity,0,57,4,4,1041
one dollar sign damn hyperspace,0,468,10,10,216
it would to be respond right when you start cause he shoots you right away,0,647,7,7,208
p so right now points are very off ive been doing terribly havent been paying attention to the things that have been showing up but right now ive kind of figured out how to stay in the middle somewhat,0,848,2,2,225
p alright,0,24,1,1,47
so for this game we are going to do what we did last game and stay within the fortress trying to keep shooting the fortress as much as possible but staying at a clockwise,0,848,8,8,351
oh yeah alright i see how im a i see how imma duck these things,0,16,3,3,237
so we got 2 shots right now,0,34,5,5,243
see why doesnt it go faster,0,33,7,7,805
i shot too fast to reset the vulnerability counter,0,12,4,4,477
its a little easier to know to stop your rotation,0,685,7,7,146
velocity low,0,130,4,4,298
slow down,0,127,10,10,283
alright im just gonna circle around the horizon,0,16,9,9,723
no oh phf so i double right click thats not ugh,0,52,7,7,749
the fort moves slower than i do,0,12,2,2,408
thats a friendly but im just gunna run right into the,0,825,2,2,79
oh alright just hit the enemy mine actually pretty proud of myself when i do that i dont get that much,0,404,6,6,228
how fast im posta,0,16,6,6,457
alright,0,300,8,8,378
gotta try in the control zone certainly ah,0,404,4,4,166
thats better than negative right,0,804,9,9,384
aright come on,0,16,7,7,572
a lot faster than i thought it would be,0,910,1,1,5
also kind of hard to keep my ships velocity right,0,681,1,1,200
stay on the screen come on man,0,739,5,5,55
alright go straight come on,0,210,6,6,82
okay so turn turn turn turn,0,57,2,2,926
next time i see the dollar buttons im going to click left,0,468,4,4,60
right,0,26,2,2,13
controlling this is hard,0,788,3,3,92
oh that was my worst score right there,0,558,10,10,77
alright so i have no points at this point so i forgot the letters,0,113,1,1,256
alright,0,214,10,10,393
slow down,0,51,4,4,115
alright i it was ezekiel so thats a friend,0,20,8,8,707
moving way too quickly,0,14,3,3,526
so im trying just to like control this ship its very sensitive and intense so my focus is going to that but i probably should play attention to mines,0,190,1,1,108
alright,0,404,8,8,304
alright so on this one we will be trying the same go back and forth on the same side as well as we can do that or if we can try and combine the two ideas from before of flying through the screen and flying on the same side,0,848,6,6,304
this round has been going much better because i have been staying at a slow velocity,0,848,10,10,402
how do i move this over here,0,658,1,1,8
alright,0,28,2,2,73
i ran into that one like i completely lost control,0,825,6,6,185
p all right again i know,0,57,3,3,961
so the only difficult thing about the game is that you move uncontrollably,0,513,2,2,43
i need to right click then turn it into,0,52,3,3,599
alright now i know how i gotta stick a move okay i gotta stick a move,0,16,2,2,130
out of control,0,319,9,9,226
tryna avoid hyperspace now earlier in the game i wasnt,0,34,10,10,454
still gotta get the interval timing right to identify the mines,0,681,5,5,275
alright straight right,0,20,7,7,680
turn,0,57,2,2,931
so to get the bonus the points is mouse left,0,54,5,5,282
im just going to stop shooting,0,113,6,6,423
im going too slow,0,16,2,2,126
there is definitely a way to make it go slower but i cannot think of that,0,52,2,2,549
all right dollar sign,0,55,6,6,757
rotating to the right i keep focusing on the fortress,0,300,6,6,324
these tight ass turns,0,16,5,5,388
alright,0,16,1,1,18
alright,0,16,1,1,40
p oh right sorry,0,3,1,1,11
slow down,0,28,1,1,25
of course it hits me when i went into hyperspace i didnt know what was gonna come out there,0,804,10,10,400
umm i still have to get used to how sensitive the controller er the joystick is,0,468,2,2,26
slow and steady just tap it,0,41,5,5,472
probably wasnt a good strategy because i was out of the hexagon,0,977,6,6,95
in clockwise direction while i shoot,0,54,7,7,407
alright,0,16,3,3,207
i love how it just wants you to fly around the hexagon but like yea no,0,53,1,1,25
i wasnt even paying attention to the mine im just so focused on flying,0,41,9,9,589
i dont think you slow down,0,57,1,1,828
p okay alright so thats a friendly mine,0,28,1,1,60
ok so i think im definitely getting the controls a bit more each time its no longer like a umm oh maybe i can start playing the game,0,468,5,5,83
all i gotta do is keep gdoing what i was doing keep to the right go slow and well get this eventually,0,818,7,7,190
alright,0,16,4,4,342
yeah just keep flying around,0,113,2,2,307
and it lets me only move the joystick in a very like parallel movements if that makes sense,0,411,10,10,147
my score is slowly going down,0,804,8,8,373
alright so you just oh no thats not a foe but now it is,0,214,8,8,351
slow down,0,57,2,2,932
its kind of rough because the only way to slow down is moving forward in the opposite direction,0,400,2,2,59
alright q,0,16,4,4,300
like move out of the way,0,190,3,3,156
its too fast,0,46,1,1,359
yeah lets just fly straight at it,0,14,6,6,676
come on lets move out the way alright,0,16,9,9,739
go slower ok cool,0,211,8,8,113
oh i keep looping around but in how do i slow down,0,57,7,7,1311
alright i ran into that so the fortress shoots like immediately,0,190,1,1,117
alright thats round 4,0,825,4,4,154
ill probably get a good control score,0,825,10,10,300
alright,0,685,2,2,31
go forward,0,51,5,5,159
flying in circles,0,20,6,6,634
alright,0,53,7,7,303
ok turn,0,210,5,5,65
like i said about the inverted youre so used to one side of the screen then the controls just change,0,977,10,10,117
immeadiately moves and gets hit,0,12,3,3,452
my control has been good,0,825,10,10,299
okay but velocity that was one of them,0,57,4,4,1050
now now right there,0,57,1,1,861
oh going too fast,0,319,4,4,81
theres the turnaround,0,40,5,5,95
slowly drift away,0,14,7,7,693
not into hyper drive,0,14,4,4,563
okay i have one shot left,0,41,3,3,402
i got it right there,0,16,1,1,73
its hard to stay in this octagon i mean hexagon,0,454,3,3,181
alright,0,404,5,5,196
turn around,0,28,2,2,74
they always go counterclockwise,0,57,5,5,1126
its like impossible to shoot right,0,3,2,2,32
alright come on friend come on friend come on friend,0,16,2,2,132
turn,0,57,2,2,900
slow down,0,454,10,10,251
alright,0,28,5,5,224
im getting the wholes hitting the center thing its hard to focus on the control paneling while doing other stuff,0,647,2,2,136
f mine thats bad mine i gotta do the too quick on the interval and im still trying to gain control this is really difficult i got shot i getting shot again,0,41,1,1,314
friendly mine mumbles still going way too fast,0,848,1,1,198
hey go forward,0,28,1,1,14
between the key so like see like its the exact time that you need to press to change so that you dont go too fast,0,214,5,5,308
go forward,0,20,1,1,403
p alright umm the hardest part to me is staying inside the hexagon umm and i guess yeah staying inside the hexagon is probably the hardest thing,0,685,2,2,27
2 5 oh too fast dang it,0,211,10,10,132
too fast too fast too fast,0,14,2,2,493
your shipped wrapped around the screen 42 times,0,53,2,2,88
just outer space ya know,0,214,9,9,375
two personal space,0,53,6,6,257
p trying to keep a handle on the control there,0,210,1,1,8
im getting too busy staying in the circle and im forgetting to shoot,0,20,7,7,664
dog i cannot turn for shit,0,16,9,9,700
umm im doing a little bit better i think the control on this game is a lot better on this game than the other games and its the last game so i didnt expect it to be better,0,685,10,10,222
going way too fast,0,848,1,1,208
if im going too slowly itll get me,0,46,9,9,583
yeah it would take me a long time to learn how to control this thing here,0,127,5,5,201
slow down,0,51,9,9,371
74 shots left,0,372,2,2,27
left click,0,51,6,6,221
alright come on,0,16,4,4,307
get this one game right,0,16,8,8,657
alright and were just gonna keep following the train,0,818,6,6,137
i even drew a flight pattern i knew when to turn,0,53,10,10,480
its turning,0,55,6,6,777
alright woah woah where are you going,0,53,5,5,218
alright so uhh because im pressing all the keys,0,52,1,1,486
alright im start moving,0,54,5,5,322
no were just gonna lose complete control,0,818,7,7,184
i just reset my vulnerability cuz im losing control,0,14,9,9,785
alright gotta get a little bit faster,0,568,2,2,48
p alright the foes are umh,0,372,2,2,21
how do you slow down,0,647,1,1,129
im just gonna move like this nope that aint gonna work,0,16,9,9,728
lemmy get this moving down,0,16,1,1,45
alright same shit,0,16,9,9,685
and im basically just out of control at this point,0,14,1,1,439
slow down,0,51,3,3,73
i pride myself in this type of stuff but i do not feel good right now,0,49,9,9,485
the focus is going slow again,0,300,5,5,299
come on just wanna rotate,0,30,2,2,69
ill just fly around until theres another bonus,0,3,7,7,144
so right click,0,14,7,7,719
flying flying everywhere,0,647,4,4,166
okay oh my god im going way too fast,0,818,1,1,13
okay thats fast,0,51,3,3,59
but its difficult to control this thing,0,54,8,8,424
alright o that is an enemy so i have to wait,0,20,9,9,765
there we go nice and slow,0,41,10,10,617
alright so i got hit again im still trying to stay on the same side and go at a somewhat slow velocity,0,848,5,5,291
get hit right at the start,0,46,3,3,398
fly up fly up fly up fly up,0,30,10,10,522
and then ill confuse the shoot button with forward and ill miss shots,0,432,3,3,126
two personal space,0,53,6,6,266
hyperspace game,0,53,6,6,290
come on left hand,0,16,4,4,263
get more control,0,130,5,5,328
get it right,0,454,2,2,161
alright i think i clicked it too rapidly and now this thing is coming to kill me,0,558,5,5,34
there was just another mine on the screen but that one was friendly so it was able to be shot,0,848,7,7,335
stop,0,51,6,6,177
when the foe mines are dq and n i have to try and turn them into friendly mines by double clicking which i feel can kill,0,52,9,9,819
turn,0,56,4,4,50
alright heres the thing,0,28,2,2,67
really wish i could get to a slower but i cant seem to do that,0,52,9,9,821
straight right straight right and left left straight oh ok straight make a right go back go straight alright come on,0,20,7,7,661
come on rotate,0,127,8,8,251
ah alright go around okay keep him there,0,210,3,3,36
basically alright im going to try this,0,51,2,2,36
p so i have a little better understanding of what is going on because i actually just realized that i am supposed to like the ship turns and i boost it its not actually moving in the direction if that makes any sense at all,0,558,2,2,9
alright alright just got to take shots,0,113,10,10,533
mumbles going too fast going way too fast,0,319,3,3,63
p there is no strategy going on here i will tell you that right now im just trying to get a hold of the controls here,0,568,1,1,17
p i mean its not really controlling not really moving,0,18,1,1,23
mumbles alright now im trying to fly around the fortress the best as possible without going over but got shot,0,848,3,3,240
finally stopped getting hit immediately,0,24,2,2,68
we have to go the opposite way to accelerate daf no that was me,0,130,7,7,373
i probably gotta turn the other way,0,16,9,9,696
oh no alright and,0,33,4,4,677
alright thats maybe slightly worse mumble,0,468,3,3,43
alright,0,818,2,2,23
having trouble controlling it,0,46,4,4,432
slow down,0,51,8,8,315
slow and i still dont know how to control this,0,29,6,6,498
moving too fast,0,3,7,7,123
too fast,0,647,9,9,223
all right hashtag,0,55,8,8,909
my strategy is to move to the ends of the hexagon before shooting the fortress,0,300,8,8,384
alright,0,739,10,10,106
friend or foe mouse right,0,54,5,5,286
i mean i got a horrible score but that was the closest i got i just thought i just keep when i heard the rules it has to be under 250 for your last two shots so thats why i keep hitting it really fast but its over 250 but like consecutive like twice in a row,0,404,7,7,278
okay im trying to control it,0,51,1,1,4
rotate come on come on,0,127,6,6,227
i got the bonus too alright,0,33,9,9,875
almost a complete hexagon,0,52,5,5,664
alright,0,788,8,8,157
alright,0,404,8,8,291
vulnerability at 3 which is good im not at total negative points right now,0,804,7,7,333
p yeah alright back to 2,0,558,4,4,26
like if im like right here it always misses,0,57,9,9,1396
not worried about bonuses right now,0,28,3,3,132
ship doesnt slow down at all,0,804,1,1,240
the way the hexagon is shaped its kind of like it makes it a bit easier if you just follow the shape of the hexagon like you should be able to stay in that you know,0,214,5,5,293
p bdm thats too close to bdsm alright,0,29,9,9,570
p oh alright,0,190,8,8,203
so lets try to cancel out my normal points with the velocity points,0,34,10,10,483
actually staying in the control zone more than i thought it would,0,404,8,8,322
trying to slow myself down going too fast,0,300,10,10,421

96 shots left,0,26,4,4,54
lemmy learn how to turn,0,16,4,4,287
the controls are really the hardest part im having a hard part controlling the ship at all much less worrying about the mines,0,404,1,1,27
stop it,0,52,9,9,834
alright my ship moves then to apply thrust it doesnt like the opposite key 4 and 6 and then the opposite key 2 and 8 doesnt really work,0,977,1,1,53
i was like i knew controlling the ship was going to be pretty difficult but i didnt realize that everything was going to be so fast paced,0,404,4,4,126
oops see now im completely out of control,0,319,2,2,31
try to move slowly not bother with anything other than moving,0,14,1,1,443
right now its at 6,0,46,5,5,451
alright lets get it,0,16,5,5,393
we cannot lose these points right now,0,20,9,9,756
p what im trying to do is trying to get control,0,788,2,2,64
theres completely no how do you control this thing,0,214,1,1,187
p its pretty fastpaced,0,38,3,3,197
p alright playing the full game,0,14,2,2,459
alright,0,190,2,2,134
i should really stop passing i should really stop just coasting around this,0,825,3,3,100
ok so i may not be staying in the middle as much as i want to but i definitely feel more in control of my movements,0,468,7,7,164
just coast right on by,0,818,10,10,271
slow it down,0,28,5,5,208
i cant tell if its a bad idea or not but its better than what it was at least i its flying off into hyper space,0,569,2,2,123
i am staying on the screen more,0,53,4,4,179
going all over the screen,0,739,9,9,96
stabilized now keep wrapping around the hexagon,0,809,4,4,77
im just trying to figure out cuz i cant hit the fortress unless i make it vulnerable unless i kill the mine first right if its a friend mine,0,49,4,4,370
alright so foe,0,809,7,7,128
your ship wrapped the screen 28 times,0,54,1,1,199
p alright,0,26,1,1,10
im starting to lose control again,0,788,10,10,185
all i know is that im being an idiot with how im flying around,0,14,5,5,620
alright come on man,0,16,7,7,577
wish it didnt shoot right away when the game starts makes it a little difficult,0,34,7,7,338
p alright,0,685,1,1,20
alright 6 6 7 7 i got the bonus and got hit at the same time,0,29,8,8,566
p alright,0,568,2,2,35
okay i already died so i guess im just assessing this right,0,113,5,5,377
dam those i thought i was slidin alright come on,0,16,5,5,380
hold on slow down,0,56,7,7,94
oh that is a friend alright alright,0,20,7,7,672
alright,0,568,1,1,15
is it i gotta slow down,0,41,4,4,440
had to turn it into a,0,52,5,5,681
alrighty,0,41,2,2,342
i pretty much have to hit it two more times right,0,404,5,5,209
turn and move,0,16,4,4,277
move it around,0,130,10,10,416
okay well im kind getting how the movement works,0,34,9,9,417
oh lets get out of here and hyperspace,0,34,7,7,354
trying to slow down taking,0,14,1,1,449
i cant i have to turn that into a and then,0,52,5,5,672
no its too slow,0,29,6,6,487
i need to slow down,0,53,8,8,388
turn,0,57,8,8,1344
alright fxd are the enemy mines,0,319,3,3,48
i thought that was right,0,16,3,3,209
already out of control here and got it,0,155,6,6,233
just slow down,0,14,2,2,479
atleast i got the bonuses right now,0,210,3,3,28
just go to the right,0,818,9,9,218
mumbles thats a friendly mine right there,0,319,2,2,26
this is the key to it going slow like they say in the video that mine is bad just threw me for a loop okay really slow down i should have taken the bonus shots,0,41,5,5,455
it accelerates so quickly,0,52,1,1,507
and i okay okay ive lost control a little bit,0,685,2,2,30
p yeah ive never been in space so i dont have too much experience,0,190,2,2,123
hey stop hitting me,0,113,3,3,323
control,0,54,4,4,276
im completely forgetting to shoot cuz im trying to get used to controls and mines are a pain in the but,0,14,1,1,445
turn,0,127,6,6,217
go forward,0,51,5,5,162
alright its getting a little easier now after 7 games im able to oh shoot okay,0,685,7,7,144
x friendly mine try to shoot it alright just hit it,0,404,7,7,268
i keep going into hyperspace though,0,34,2,2,73
how can i make this thing slow down,0,52,2,2,535
as soon as you start the fortress gets hits on you for real like its just restarting up slow,0,804,3,3,258
okay im dead okay my velocity score is actually not that x is a good mine,0,41,5,5,462
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,7,7,584
usually when its closer or go slower i do worse,0,211,6,6,87
so double right click and then shoot at it,0,52,10,10,862
just slow down,0,30,5,5,244
still trying to gain control,0,41,1,1,318
i dont like how it shoots me right awaythats all im saying,0,3,2,2,30
it moves so fast that,0,127,1,1,139
so when you see a foe mine youre supposed to press the right mouse button twice right,0,411,5,5,80
i think i got a little bit of control,0,372,1,1,8
need to slow down,0,28,8,8,342
come on slow down slow down slow down,0,127,10,10,287
the controller inverted that is kind of frustrating,0,977,3,3,73
didnt get hit right away,0,804,7,7,313
14 shots left,0,26,3,3,39
left click,0,51,6,6,220
so if i double click i can go faster but i dont want it to go faster,0,54,10,10,470
too fast,0,809,6,6,105
going slow enough so ican see,0,569,7,7,209
because then it flips if i get out of bounds,0,57,4,4,1079
going too fast,0,49,4,4,362
p im still attempting to fly in a counterclockwise direction but its a lot harder than i anticipated it but i feel like im getting the hang of it slowly,0,45,2,2,15
circles,0,26,7,7,117
22 shots left,0,26,5,5,79
4 5 so fast now,0,211,10,10,139
and im not even like able to think about the foes im really just stuck trying to control the ship,0,214,2,2,228
im not really grasping the whole thrust thing,0,977,1,1,51
no i was too slow,0,34,3,3,124
come on get turned around,0,55,10,10,998
okay way to slow,0,34,2,2,101
5 vulnerability right now i only need oh no,0,130,5,5,322
alright were moving very slowly,0,28,2,2,99
alright,0,16,8,8,651
got the right keys this time,0,46,8,8,537
alright,0,16,3,3,248
alright what is it,0,16,5,5,365
ive also just kind of completelt disregardedsp control and velocity at this point and focused on getting mine hits,0,12,3,3,431
slowly,0,28,4,4,174
i lost control of that,0,685,9,9,201
i should be able to hold it at a diagonal and that around thing in that hexagon but that is not been working for me,0,47,7,7,103
this thing is moving fast,0,818,1,1,9
no no just flying around,0,818,9,9,228
right click when theres no uh mine on the screen,0,52,10,10,852
i need to slow down,0,54,6,6,367
it keeps you in control,0,214,5,5,311
no for everything ive done so far i havent havent turned a friendly mine into a foe mine,0,41,6,6,495
still dint move fast enough,0,12,3,3,445
alright right now im just trying to not mumbles,0,468,1,1,12
that was also a foe so i will have to avoid that mine and reset the game plan because i  once you leave the flight pattern it is very hard to get it back,0,848,9,9,390
straight straight left ok straight oh that didnt work out,0,20,7,7,673
now control this is really evil,0,41,3,3,398
alright,0,54,1,1,200
is it when the when the little money sign like doesnt it like have to appear twice in one round for me to get the thing or can it like i killed a spaceship in between them,0,40,5,5,93
i thats a friendly alright im at 10,0,404,9,9,342
alright,0,28,8,8,362
whats going on right now,0,739,4,4,42
in the hexagon in the hexagon,0,52,2,2,551
alright 6 vulnerability,0,33,4,4,684
alright 9 vulnerability im 1 shot away from dying,0,41,10,10,642
ok now i got a little hang of it still kind of uncontrolled,0,210,2,2,22
i like the counterclockwise,0,432,2,2,113
alright,0,319,5,5,112
the screen went black,0,910,1,1,21
flew right into shots,0,3,6,6,105
p im trying to figure out the controls,0,49,1,1,253
p try to keep control here,0,50,10,10,123
ah no turn ah theres a mine,0,33,2,2,598
alright i gotta go up,0,49,2,2,287
5 row diamond thing need to stop following me,0,569,4,4,159
im not supposed to be flying out of there i lose points,0,20,3,3,508
just so many working parts you have to move immediately or else this guy will shoot you but if you move too fast you might as well restart,0,977,9,9,112
i aint cluch with the right clicks,0,16,9,9,750
hyperspace i can see now,0,127,10,10,289
okay so this is definitely the best flight pattern,0,12,8,8,613
slow down,0,51,6,6,207
it moves differently sometimes,0,211,2,2,21
my velocity needs to go up,0,33,7,7,819
oh slow,0,28,7,7,305
alright lets get it,0,16,3,3,245
no no stop,0,14,5,5,598
p alright,0,127,7,7,231
moving too fast again,0,12,2,2,416
p so i pretty much like given up on trying to stay in the hexagon cuz im just going all over the place but its mumbles no,0,190,2,2,143
i think i also forget i can shoot faster than mumbles every 5 seconds,0,432,6,6,155
its difficult to juts stay in the hexagon when youre moving and trying to shoot at the fortress too,0,54,3,3,234
all right so dollar sign,0,57,1,1,839
turn turn turn come on,0,127,6,6,214
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,4,4,295
tilt it a little bit going too fast going too fast dollar sign shows up the first time friendly mine on screen second dollar sign,0,319,7,7,165
and turn again,0,28,2,2,76
okay slow down slow down,0,41,4,4,434
come on alright bad,0,16,3,3,238
514 alrighty,0,41,5,5,471
focusing on the base right now not the mines,0,300,10,10,417
personal space,0,53,6,6,255
alright ok oh no,0,53,2,2,70
alright,0,16,3,3,211
i cant control it,0,29,8,8,563
but theres a dollar sign thatssecond dollar sign 77 shots left,0,130,6,6,338
going very fast dont know why,0,29,4,4,412
alright thats a bonus,0,825,5,5,167
everything is coming from control which is weird cause i dont feel in control,0,12,7,7,607
quails stop x rays because their shells are really hard,0,53,10,10,454
also slow down,0,12,3,3,453
its slow down,0,12,7,7,587
nah thats just cuz im clicking too fast,0,30,9,9,509
slow,0,210,8,8,135
alright 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 destroyed it,0,372,6,6,76
im like trying to stay on the screen,0,214,3,3,251
damn alright im just gonna ride,0,16,8,8,647
okay i dont care if i go out of bounds,0,16,2,2,103
alright one  sign,0,20,3,3,478
its just the ship moves so fast,0,214,2,2,226
i need to slow myself down first and line myself first and slowly cross the base,0,300,10,10,415
p hgt okay if its hg and t stop them if its not well im gunna forget this is only round two,0,825,2,2,46
alright,0,16,5,5,360
slow down,0,51,3,3,56
p that is a friendly mine obviously out of control ok,0,404,5,5,190
actually managing to get off a lot of shots im at 6 right now,0,404,3,3,114
and we are flying through the corner of the ship so i believe the points are counterbalanced,0,848,9,9,385
i feel like if i move at all im going to go out of control,0,809,2,2,47
i just never had to play a game where you had to like point in the direction you wanted to move and then go in that direction,0,214,4,4,270
turn then move,0,16,6,6,498
alright,0,16,5,5,402
whenever you go really fast its easier to die than to stabilize yourself because its never going to work,0,513,5,5,64
im pretty sure like with like the right control like 1000 points is definitely obtainable,0,825,5,5,160
dont know if thats right,0,3,10,10,219
it takes a lot of control like i know if my brother were to try this he would be very like frantic and that wouldnt be like that would be difficult like hes,0,825,5,5,161
inaudible okay one life left per game,0,27,2,2,31
slow down,0,29,4,4,414
when youre moving too fast its probably best to just like let yourself fly off the screen cause then you can like instead of turning around it does it for you basically,0,12,4,4,482
trying to keep it on the screen,0,739,3,3,32
i keep thinking that the bonus is my like controller,0,52,6,6,731
p when i saw the lkc i tried to remember it as okc like the oklahoma city thunder so hopefully that will help a little bit remembering those but control is still extremely bad,0,558,5,5,31
stop shooting at me so i can move,0,14,3,3,535
okay lemmy move out the way,0,16,1,1,31
p alright same shit,0,16,6,6,434
circle around,0,319,2,2,34
dont judge me on my knowledge of quails,0,53,10,10,468
no just stay in the circle,0,647,3,3,155
even though i dont know how to control,0,29,5,5,464
alright thats an enemy mine going too fast my velocity is always negative,0,130,7,7,369
i tryinna slow down and shit,0,16,8,8,664
ah going too fast cant adjust,0,411,10,10,151
unintelligible i just wish i wouldnt be going so fast,0,804,6,6,299
going too fast again,0,46,2,2,382
uh i cant even keep it on the screen,0,739,2,2,26
im going to move extra slow when im getting at the ends of the hexagon,0,300,8,8,382
for some reason it cant really hit any if im outside of the hexagon,0,57,9,9,1394
trying to fix myself to go clockwise again,0,300,4,4,284
definitely going way to fast,0,52,2,2,529
trying to do a counterclockwise position,0,41,1,1,304
alright whats next,0,16,4,4,324
