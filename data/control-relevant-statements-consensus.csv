oh that was a fast one,0,20,7,7,683
go right go straight,0,20,6,6,603
no dont lose control yet,0,685,4,4,85
okay alright were gonna go the optimal path now,0,818,3,3,43
alright imma just work like this,0,16,3,3,233
wow okay thats i think i have one more hit left,0,34,6,6,285
slow down,0,28,2,2,105
once i learn how to turn i swear ill get the game right,0,16,4,4,275
p oh alright,0,404,1,1,18
slow down,0,131,1,1,29
alright,0,28,7,7,284
alright now im at vulnerability 4 mumbling,0,404,6,6,218
too fast,0,788,2,2,80
ah ok i see alright,0,214,1,1,189
umm the whole counterclockwise trying to move in the control zone is really iffy for me,0,404,8,8,319
i need it to go slower i need it to calm down,0,52,8,8,801
p alright that was really frustrating because it kind of got stuck in an endless loop in between both sides,0,558,3,3,15
thats 12 and i mumbles alright,0,788,8,8,160
ohhh right on time,0,53,9,9,443
not staying inside the hexagon now i am,0,569,8,8,221
turn,0,51,5,5,158
13 shots left,0,26,9,9,159
im going to try shooting at a slower rate this time,0,300,4,4,285
mumbles out go back in mumbles move or stay inside okay,0,26,8,8,125
yeah the way that the hexagon changes its like um its perfect,0,214,5,5,303
haha i think my ultimate strategy here is to really not even worry about the control zone because it is so hard to stay in,0,404,2,2,78
oh ive gotten to slow down officially now,0,113,8,8,488
too fast,0,40,3,3,69
so just constantly moving,0,400,1,1,48
turn go forward go forward there you go forward turn,0,210,5,5,55
for this game we are going to try and do originally what the goal of the game is to fly in a hexagon around the fortress periodically shooting it for some reason it has not shot at me yet,0,848,7,7,331
and i have it right within what i need,0,34,4,4,166
pokay mouse right,0,55,1,1,539
for some reason the fortress seems to like its shots are easily predictable and it only shoots when youre at a certain velocity and distance from the fortress,0,848,5,5,278
going in a circle is another thing,0,468,6,6,115
all right so try to move,0,12,1,1,350
p turn ok,0,210,4,4,48
stop on screen,0,51,8,8,316
but if my theory still proves true as soon as i get the hang of this theyll switch the controls on me,0,53,4,4,184
try to do a fly by,0,818,6,6,147
i remember what the letters were right,0,57,5,5,1154
mumbles im only pressing the shoot button and the rotate button at the same time,0,300,5,5,300
24 too fast,0,211,10,10,137
i see a foe mine mumbles moving again slowly,0,300,2,2,235
mumbles that was fast,0,788,9,9,169
alright thats my best game yet,0,41,5,5,470
p alrighty,0,41,4,4,414
so like here you go shows how he is turning to stay in the hexagon then here,0,214,5,5,301
alright,0,558,10,10,76
its just the amount you press the acceleration key like it pushes you forward,0,214,5,5,305
going too fast going too fast,0,319,9,9,221
i am trying to navigate but nothing is working and im just flying around without oh there we go,0,20,1,1,396
alright go right go that way go backwards,0,20,5,5,580
ahh alright that is t u j,0,20,2,2,427
maybe i should move in a circle because my best score came when i got 0 kills but moved in a circle,0,400,4,4,89
ok theres ok 24 i almost got it and if i stay in the center and outside the hexagon i should have the theres a dollar sign,0,569,3,3,136
forward,0,51,8,8,340
stay inside the hexagon,0,130,10,10,414
one personal space two personal space,0,53,3,3,113
kay bad mine interval too slow,0,41,9,9,593
no stop stop,0,14,4,4,569
im going so fast,0,28,6,6,257
one more turn,0,29,10,10,609
im definitely not earning points for the control,0,468,6,6,127
nope keep mumbles cannot get it to stay in the hexagon,0,52,3,3,564
okay this is difficult to control,0,52,1,1,485
alright 5 hits on the vulnerability counter,0,372,2,2,31
i dont like going into hyperspace but sometimes hyperspace is the only way you can get away,0,804,8,8,372
turn turn turn,0,127,9,9,264
yeah go forward,0,28,3,3,140
i got no control over this and its bad,0,49,2,2,324
getting out of control,0,319,7,7,181
but im moving i dont,0,54,10,10,466
p slow down bonus missiles,0,50,9,9,108
going nice and slow,0,41,5,5,454
yup turn then move,0,16,6,6,447
left,0,51,10,10,429
its best to use light taps to move the ship around rather than long drawnout ones or else itll get crazy and start flying everywhere,0,681,2,2,238
im not going to try to go in the clockwise motion im just going to shoot at it and hope for the best,0,411,2,2,29
oh i still cant control the ship and ive been playing this for a little while now its insane,0,214,3,3,248
okay gotta get in control,0,214,10,10,408
i try simultaneously pressing the forward and right button seeing if that helps the control,0,300,3,3,246
mine cane okay gotta really figure out how to control my ship here go the opposite direction so i want okay now im in like a good like,0,41,3,3,397
were gonna go the optimal path this time alright gonna turn around alright lets gothats not that fast,0,818,1,1,7
i just care about getting shot because the fortress shoots you very fast,0,400,2,2,63
alright shot it again,0,473,7,7,305
alright a so,0,473,1,1,164
now im lost in hyperspace trying to gain control,0,468,7,7,144
im missing a lot of point right now,0,34,1,1,41
alright,0,319,2,2,28
theres one right here so i got the bonus,0,848,4,4,265
alright this does nothin,0,16,5,5,348
so very much needs to slow down,0,12,3,3,441
alright so for our last trial i will try and stay in the fortress as best as possible following the original game plan of spinning clockwise while trying to avoid the mines and shots,0,848,10,10,396
d friendly im in a bad spot ah man im not going very fast but not slow either,0,404,6,6,234
no alright alright ok nope nope turn,0,210,3,3,32
and keep flying and control is actually good but my points suck,0,33,8,8,831
gimme that right back,0,16,6,6,452
interval was right,0,34,1,1,37
slow down,0,739,9,9,89
alright so this time we will try and not to suffer mumbles this game is a little more just kinda rogue flying around not 100 staying within the boundaries but trying to not go into hyperspace,0,848,8,8,363
um its not worth going in a circle,0,3,3,3,50
cant do anything else right,0,52,3,3,596
im more of a controller person,0,53,2,2,58
there and zs out 6 7 8 9 losing control losing control 10 oh,0,825,6,6,189
trying to avoid this hyper space is harder than i thought,0,210,6,6,81
i could fire at that if i knew how to turn,0,52,5,5,690
alright thats one dollar sign thats one dollar sign,0,16,3,3,199
alright come on,0,16,9,9,716
need to control the ship,0,28,5,5,231
just trying to get a slow kinda like slide past the tower,0,24,4,4,96
ah man okay so this thing in the hexagon,0,130,5,5,327
im just kinda going in circles,0,468,6,6,109
i didnt turn fast enough,0,46,9,9,597
i just clicked the right one,0,54,4,4,269
no left,0,51,10,10,428
come on man how fast i gotta click,0,16,7,7,540
yea i can do l turn it into,0,52,5,5,676
i feel like everytime i lose slight control i just fly off into space,0,12,2,2,424
gosh until you lose control,0,214,3,3,244
alright nope nope nope nope nope nope nope,0,818,2,2,19
stop spinning fly direct,0,210,4,4,40
p it accelerates really really fast and then,0,130,1,1,236
okay perfect its missing me so im doing good right now,0,34,10,10,478
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,6,6,438
cant go backwards,0,51,6,6,224
and mumbles 6 shots left,0,432,10,10,214
p vyb alright vyb,0,127,6,6,213
so much for control points,0,12,6,6,541
no not fast enough,0,400,5,5,99
alright thats two down,0,16,3,3,244
and yeah im so focused on controlling myself that i cant but its coming easier soon ill be able to get this fortress,0,214,6,6,319
so i guess my strategy is to just go around it and shoot at the fortress and make it go as slow as i can,0,211,2,2,31
p oh ok its moving very fast,0,211,1,1,3
p okay my points never gonna im never gonna get high points cuz i wrap the screen too much so,0,16,2,2,171
mumbles have to turn it into a ooh dollar sigh,0,52,6,6,707
alright,0,454,3,3,180
one come on slow down slow down,0,53,7,7,297
need to slow down,0,14,4,4,562
alright so i think i got a strategy going,0,568,3,3,68
slow down ship,0,214,3,3,257
alright so i gotta retry the strategy i gotta get it going straight first which is the tricky part,0,848,2,2,221
i cant slow it down,0,127,5,5,208
okay okay alright nice and slow,0,41,1,1,319
okay turn,0,54,1,1,189
all right so thatll take like forever to get used to i guess,0,12,1,1,345
if i dont do it right than im just im dead,0,40,3,3,64
slow down,0,28,6,6,259
turn turn turn,0,127,6,6,218
mine came at me i couldnt press fast enough,0,300,2,2,237
bonus left,0,27,6,6,111
gotta be fast,0,647,7,7,206
alright you have to be a pro gamer to do well in this game,0,20,7,7,666
p  alright,0,319,4,4,92
counterclockwise huh maybe i was wrong,0,53,3,3,94
hey alright mumbles,0,30,6,6,291
im not good mumbles that can actually like stay they just like stay in the hexagon i just feel like they dont go out to the screen that often,0,57,9,9,1404
i keep doing better when it brings me in because when im out on the edges its way more difficult,0,211,4,4,49
4 5 6 7 8 you know if you go to hyperspace you just confuse the please dont die im so close 9 more tod no tod,0,41,7,7,524
what left,0,51,10,10,398
turn and thrust and then turn and then thrust,0,53,10,10,472
alright im going to try this again,0,20,9,9,734
alright this is a little bit easier to control,0,372,2,2,22
hyperspace captain,0,53,4,4,174
alright,0,28,10,10,422
counterclockwise,0,432,8,8,183
and a little bit forward,0,28,4,4,172
okay score is slowly going up,0,681,3,3,249
its off the screen,0,3,4,4,72
were at 5 vulnerability right now so that nice,0,34,2,2,72
it doesnt really matter where youre facing you have to keep moving to not get shot but stop moving by turning completely around and going in that direction,0,513,3,3,49
turn thrust,0,53,10,10,477
and then just trying to stay inside the hexagon,0,130,2,2,244
key is doing it slow and steady i too quick avoid avoid okay,0,41,5,5,453
alright lemmy learn how to turn,0,16,4,4,274
too fast,0,127,6,6,216
p stay inside this hexagon,0,50,6,6,64
p yeah i dont really got a lot of thoughts right now,0,49,1,1,264
its very difficult to control the thing and i wish this guy would stop trying to shoot me and lets see,0,47,1,1,5
yeah its just really hard with the arrows keys to keep your ship in control while its moving around frictionless,0,681,1,1,202
slow slow down,0,404,4,4,145
ah moving pretty fast now i gotta slow down a bit,0,404,3,3,102
alright,0,28,6,6,247
mumbles dont want to go out of bounds because it completely completely flips the guy so its confusing,0,57,3,3,1011
umm but so i guess the what you were saying was like youre trying to accelerate in the,0,468,2,2,22
p im trying to slow this ship down and tilt it a little bit forward but it keeps going faster which really sucks,0,411,4,4,53
alright thats one down,0,16,7,7,536
it already hit me theres so many theyre all interfering with each other i cant remember which ones were the right ones,0,190,3,3,158
all right i just wanna try getting the hang of just going around the recurrent way,0,57,2,2,895
p no no i wish i did i just gotta get a hold of the controls for the most part i was actually like spinning around inside the hexagon a little bit but it was just that those mines really like got me scared a little bit and i just like lost control and like ok how do i get this back,0,568,2,2,58
im just like gonna tap right now,0,49,1,1,265
if i could turn this thing,0,29,9,9,580
no zoom velocity,0,57,4,4,1039
turn turn turn,0,127,10,10,276
p oer try slowing down a bit,0,29,4,4,403
i didnt realize i was going to be moving,0,54,1,1,180
im losing points as im in hyperspace,0,57,6,6,1218
okay yeah so you have to like point before you can move forward,0,214,1,1,205
okay stay within the lines mumble hyperspace,0,804,10,10,419
okay wow im losing so many points right now,0,34,7,7,358
more control i get over it the slower i move it and what ends up happening is i get hit by the enemy fortress,0,404,4,4,144
i cant even stay in the circle,0,20,1,1,391
p im clicking the right mouse,0,33,9,9,863
the optimal flight pattern that i had initially thought of is not the one im taking,0,12,2,2,411
alright im out one,0,16,6,6,490
turn turn turn turn around turn around there you go,0,210,5,5,58
turn and oh dead,0,28,3,3,143
fast enough to make it work,0,40,3,3,66
always be turning,0,513,3,3,50
its just staying inside this hexagon is the worst part,0,685,5,5,106
turn again this way,0,57,2,2,902
alright come on come on,0,16,6,6,489
alright turn,0,28,4,4,194
almost got a full circle,0,739,9,9,98
focus to get inside the hexagon,0,300,1,1,199
its easier to stay in hyperspace than inside the hexagon,0,300,2,2,232
alright space bar,0,190,2,2,128
i gotta stop missing,0,24,5,5,119
alright get out that shit,0,16,10,10,820
alright well i always seem to keep getting shot at so im juts going to move around,0,54,7,7,392
nope no i just did a complete circle for some reason,0,818,6,6,138
