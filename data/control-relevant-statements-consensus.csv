spaceship doesnt stop at all which doesnt help at all,0,804,1,1,243
all right,0,55,10,10,1015
yeah its just really hard with the arrows keys to keep your ship in control while its moving around frictionless,0,681,1,1,202
also they should update their papers to show those blue squares as actually moving cuz i thought they would be damn uninterpretable i thought theyd be stationary on the side,0,41,7,7,547
hopefully ill destroy it 6 times im moving much slower than last time,0,825,10,10,288
turn around,0,57,1,1,755
run forward,0,30,8,8,443
p alright the foe mines are q v and w,0,848,10,10,391
not even using the mouse right now,0,404,2,2,69
oh this is really alright,0,568,1,1,6
need to control the ship,0,28,5,5,231
o thats a friendly alright,0,404,10,10,381
moving forward,0,57,4,4,1031
alright,0,685,1,1,6
20 but dont fly out of the screen,0,569,9,9,243
too fast aww i got to pay attention to that,0,211,6,6,81
stop turning stop turning,0,155,7,7,269
alright,0,29,4,4,443
alright were at 8 right now 9,0,14,10,10,853
speed 100 velocity 250,0,34,6,6,319
turn around,0,55,3,3,643
alright 4 probably gonna screen wrap 100 times here,0,404,7,7,260
once you lose control of the ship its really hard to get it back so its important to not mess up in the beginning,0,400,5,5,126
umm oh so you just bounce off the middle very interesting i wonder if that can be used strategically to stop yourself,0,468,7,7,148
kidding go to the right,0,300,3,3,286
i get points deducted every time i go into hyperspace but it might be a move,0,53,8,8,365
turn thrust turn thrust turn thrust,0,53,10,10,481
also kind of hard to keep my ships velocity right,0,681,1,1,200
all right,0,57,10,10,1488
yep fly right into it,0,30,6,6,318
p alright,0,16,2,2,90
stop hitting the center,0,51,9,9,369
the control is real touchy i gotta get used to it,0,681,1,1,189
this thing is moving fast,0,818,1,1,9
ill make a little forward a little,0,57,7,7,1266
oh thats an enemy turn around,0,55,10,10,1009
got it oh man this is the second part of the hyperspace yep got it,0,818,4,4,77
dollar signs popped up one time enemy mine going out of control,0,319,4,4,106
alright so the first dollar sign,0,130,6,6,334
ok hes at 10 now ah man alright if i could just not mess this up i can actually manage to,0,404,5,5,189
alright there we go,0,51,4,4,93
i cannot slow down enough to there we go rotating,0,569,3,3,180
slow down,0,51,4,4,92
i thought i was getting good at flying,0,20,3,3,497
this one we will continue the technique and try to stay in the smaller or larger hexagon to receive points for control,0,848,7,7,336
umm the whole counterclockwise trying to move in the control zone is really iffy for me,0,404,8,8,319
dude im not even trying to go for bonus points right now,0,49,9,9,473
so this is right this is left this is straight,0,20,7,7,649
turn ok,0,210,7,7,114
slow down,0,28,6,6,259
stop spinning whats up with the spinning,0,210,4,4,41
alright well im taking a bunch of hits im going to explode in 1 more hit,0,825,6,6,182
keep it slow,0,300,8,8,378
thats better than negative right,0,804,9,9,384
i tried to stay in the hexagon that time,0,468,4,4,50
if i do the right math wait points matter two,0,825,10,10,302
another mine on the screen but that one just ran into me without any problems so that was friendly,0,848,2,2,253
this is extremely difficult i go very very fast,0,34,1,1,25
and if you hold it down one direction like left or right the ship just spirals out of control,0,977,1,1,81
i dont feel like im in control,0,210,2,2,24
p yeah im just trying to concentrate on here because like i said its very difficult doing this lefthanded,0,127,5,5,244
so when you see a foe mine youre supposed to press the right mouse button twice right,0,411,5,5,80
saw the dollar now i can time it right for the other dollar,0,569,8,8,234
p when i saw the lkc i tried to remember it as okc like the oklahoma city thunder so hopefully that will help a little bit remembering those but control is still extremely bad,0,558,5,5,31
left,0,51,10,10,429
and rotation,0,30,8,8,447
alright o that is an enemy so i have to wait,0,20,9,9,765
p im trying not to collide with the center so i dont warp out of the screen,0,217,4,4,71
slow down,0,56,7,7,100
too slowly there,0,404,7,7,250
slow down first,0,300,5,5,317
my velocity,0,57,6,6,1189
oh that was too fast,0,568,2,2,41
stick and move stick and move,0,16,3,3,213
okay im going too fast,0,300,7,7,354
rotate rotate,0,30,6,6,293
actually its really not easier to maneuver,0,57,1,1,744
everything is coming from control which is weird cause i dont feel in control,0,12,7,7,607
im too strong with the thrust,0,16,9,9,693
alright where the next motherfworder at,0,16,7,7,580
mumbles turn,0,56,5,5,55
turn turn then go straight,0,28,2,2,75
alright come on,0,16,5,5,384
this stick is really alright,0,568,1,1,23
ah the ship doesnt move fast enough,0,404,4,4,140
straight left i didnt even look ok,0,20,7,7,674
too fast,0,41,10,10,639
alright,0,16,2,2,172
hey go forward,0,28,1,1,14
alright,0,404,5,5,196
alright come on,0,16,4,4,285
p and then i press the space bar afterwards,0,27,1,1,3
i am trying to slow down,0,53,9,9,427
alright first dollar sign,0,647,8,8,229
um i stay outside the control zone,0,404,4,4,169
just stay slow,0,28,4,4,168
my turning will never start off strong,0,16,7,7,514
back inside the hexagon,0,300,7,7,360
out of control,0,319,5,5,126
alright,0,16,3,3,229
p oh right,0,3,1,1,8
so you always wanna be moving,0,468,9,9,205
its kinda slow,0,46,5,5,425
p alright,0,20,1,1,384
told you too fast and you didnt want to listen,0,155,4,4,227
out of control,0,319,5,5,136
slow slow,0,51,3,3,81
the mines mumbling cause i couldnt get the ship controlled to save my life,0,804,7,7,327
turn and face it,0,57,10,10,1493
alright,0,28,8,8,347
no come on forward,0,55,10,10,1030
usg oh right click  right click right click,0,52,4,4,579
okay i see how i gotta move,0,16,2,2,131
alright not too shabby,0,28,4,4,185
try to stay in the hexagon,0,28,3,3,131
how fast they want it,0,16,9,9,743
kay slow down,0,51,10,10,434
alright i just got bullets because i dont want to have to worry about that so im at 100 now get out of the way zach come on,0,685,5,5,102
i press the keys too fast,0,12,5,5,505
i only have 22 shots left,0,33,3,3,548
slow,0,300,9,9,395
slash um im flying really slow in a straight line,0,3,8,8,163
forward forward forward,0,57,3,3,886
thought i got it but i was too slow,0,46,10,10,611
okay i am out of control,0,113,9,9,504
okay forward,0,55,9,9,968
uh t ah man didnt get the right interval there that was the problem,0,404,4,4,148
p okay my points never gonna im never gonna get high points cuz i wrap the screen too much so,0,16,2,2,171
alright my dog ej,0,16,3,3,187
p im trying to go clockwise,0,50,1,1,5
right click that,0,52,2,2,513
keyboard most definitely better which is not saying much but i just wanna say how bad it is to fly this keyboard not an accurate fly experience of space,0,41,4,4,448
so much flying motion,0,214,1,1,255
im going to try turning a little bit of speed,0,51,2,2,37
alright,0,16,1,1,18
spinning way out of control,0,127,10,10,293
now little better on this control thing,0,28,5,5,216
control and go slow,0,300,5,5,330
come here alright theres definitely no there definitely wasnt no o in that shit,0,16,10,10,774
alright,0,16,4,4,336
2 dollar signs bonus points i think that was an enemy mine but he was coming right at me,0,24,6,6,137
loosing control,0,818,9,9,233
i am staying on the screen more,0,53,4,4,179
p gonna stay in the hexagon,0,50,7,7,72
gotta try in the control zone certainly ah,0,404,4,4,166
alright thats a bonus,0,825,5,5,167
gonna wrap around im going too fast too fast too fast enemy mine,0,319,3,3,57
flew right into shots,0,3,6,6,105
and it is just a little tricky with the spinning but the shooting element is perfect with the new control,0,848,1,1,229
6 7 7 8 8 8 so hard to turn,0,473,2,2,232
alright try this oof,0,214,2,2,275
come on turn turn,0,127,2,2,219
oh thats right ok,0,211,4,4,59
speed is kinda slow but it works,0,46,10,10,631
alright what are you,0,113,8,8,475
ok so not going clockwise but im gonna try to stay in the middle kinda not go to hyperspace like the last few rounds,0,468,6,6,133
im not going to try to go in the clockwise motion im just going to shoot at it and hope for the best,0,411,2,2,29
i think the hardest part for me is the controlling and also the mines,0,47,7,7,110
p even though ive been playing for 40 minutes you still never get used to the controls,0,977,7,7,100
p alright last one best for last alright im going crazy,0,190,10,10,222
tilt it a little bit going too fast going too fast dollar sign shows up the first time friendly mine on screen second dollar sign,0,319,7,7,165
slow down,0,51,6,6,215
it goes really fast,0,3,1,1,9
slow down slow down,0,411,5,5,73
uh get on the screen,0,739,10,10,107
ok so just moving up and down helps a little,0,411,9,9,131
turn,0,28,4,4,189
so very much needs to slow down,0,12,3,3,441
again i cant slow down,0,569,4,4,186
i know how to move,0,16,1,1,49
alright and go,0,28,1,1,10
p the joystick movement isnt as bad like you have to be more precise but once you get used to it its easier to maneuver because it is precise like can make tiny turns,0,400,2,2,111
need to slow down,0,28,8,8,342
facing the right,0,300,9,9,404
youll probably have to hit spacebar again,0,3,1,1,6
i keep doing better when it brings me in because when im out on the edges its way more difficult,0,211,4,4,49
got three right now,0,33,4,4,566
p alright,0,404,8,8,281
aw alright,0,214,5,5,341
going too slow,0,319,8,8,197
its easier to rotate after a shot,0,57,5,5,1063
vulnerability of the fortress is now at 4 trying to stay within the confines of the hexagon,0,848,8,8,358
the firing button feels a little better but the movements dont,0,217,1,1,58
going too fast,0,46,7,7,505
sometimes when youre moving no sense of navigating and just stay on a steady axis shooting at the fortress,0,977,2,2,87
alright thats the second one down,0,825,6,6,193
i realize that during the end of the last game i was only single clicking the right i dont really know what to call it the right mouse thing instead of double clicking it to destroy the foe mines i guess you could say,0,558,4,4,21
im getting my timing right in between the shots so the counter doesnt reset,0,681,4,4,260
this is self defense right here,0,155,6,6,259
dont fly off,0,14,3,3,562
slow down,0,300,3,3,293
dang my left hand cant respond for shit,0,16,8,8,661
p yeah this thing is moving so fast its hard to pay attention to the mines and dollar signs but i know i should,0,211,2,2,33
this motherworder going fast,0,16,6,6,492
p im still struggling to fly in a counterclockwise direction and im also out of the hexagon and now im waiting for the next mine its k which means its a friend but i dont think im supposed to shoot it cause its a friend,0,45,3,3,20
move a little forward a little bit,0,28,1,1,32
very hard to control the turning or harder than the keyboard with the joystick controls,0,848,4,4,302
alright back lemmy get them points,0,16,3,3,203
i just spat all over this screen,0,52,9,9,826
the vulnerability is now at 5 4 4 and the flying through the corner of the box technique seems to be working somewhat,0,848,5,5,313
alright,0,51,4,4,123
i have no other optimal path other than going to the right,0,818,6,6,123
spin around and lose control,0,818,8,8,203
nope nope turn around turn there you go turn turn,0,210,3,3,35
p wow this oughta be interesting because i am not coordinated with my left hand,0,127,1,1,180
x thats a friendly mine going too fast going to fast,0,404,6,6,225
control the ship,0,454,8,8,242
alright now im at vulnerability 4 mumbling,0,404,6,6,218
usually i can get a couple of shots in without having to move too much cuz its only when i move that really messes me up,0,24,4,4,97
i dont know this is game breaking and its not what they really want but you know i find that its the most successful for me and it stops me from being aggravated,0,41,7,7,545
to the right,0,33,2,2,480
this actually is a little easier to control as far as speed goes but with turning its much more difficult to approximate how far you need to turn the ship needs to take,0,848,1,1,226
ahh alright that is t u j,0,20,2,2,427
turn turn turn turn around turn around there you go,0,210,5,5,58
going too fast,0,319,7,7,184
uh im moving backwards,0,3,6,6,96
alright this was by far my best run im in the 3000s,0,468,4,4,65
and alright,0,30,3,3,112
so for this game again i will be trying to go really slow since last game was one of the highest for speed that i had,0,848,4,4,289
p im trying to get back into the hexagon,0,45,8,8,83
alright so another  sign so weapons,0,20,3,3,495
left click,0,51,6,6,221
i need to slow down,0,12,4,4,471
all right,0,57,4,4,965
p alright here we go,0,214,10,10,402
there were just 2 dollar signs in a row so i received 100 point bonus but right after i was just killed by the fortress,0,848,6,6,328
i should really stop passing i should really stop just coasting around this,0,825,3,3,100
actually there is no resistance in space,0,41,4,4,449
p ok i cannot play this game right its kind of embarrassing,0,411,2,2,28
i feel like the base of the controller isnt good,0,788,2,2,155
okay so i just move extremely quickly,0,34,1,1,12
how can i not turn around and just hit it,0,52,8,8,767
why am i not moving,0,57,4,4,981
alright turn,0,28,4,4,194
not going fast enough to avoid him,0,46,1,1,300
and slow down,0,28,7,7,315
man i feel like in drifting right now man,0,16,3,3,251
left arm is getting tired from muscle confusion,0,319,9,9,237
steering out of boundsthat was terrible,0,454,1,1,134
trying to slow down,0,3,6,6,111
p yeah i was ship damaged 20 times by the fortress 8 times by mines destroyed 0 fortress i wrapped the screen 47 times,0,568,1,1,28
okay move back under somewhat control here,0,14,4,4,604
alright it just stopped again,0,29,2,2,378
p that first one is like really hard to avoid because its like right there as soon as you start,0,190,9,9,216
alright thats one down,0,16,7,7,536
just gonna keep going to the right same thing ive been doing trying not to fail taking out the mines doing pretty bad pretty bad,0,818,9,9,237
p biggest issue is moving this thing forward,0,432,1,1,135
stop dying,0,113,2,2,355
im just gonna oh i can alright,0,28,5,5,222
i mean i got a horrible score but that was the closest i got i just thought i just keep when i heard the rules it has to be under 250 for your last two shots so thats why i keep hitting it really fast but its over 250 but like consecutive like twice in a row,0,404,7,7,278
its really hard to like point in the right direction,0,190,1,1,139
wait slow slow,0,53,3,3,123
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,4,4,310
slow down,0,51,8,8,314
come go forward,0,55,7,7,848
alright no,0,28,3,3,124
i only wish that there was a slow down button,0,411,8,8,125
straight left,0,20,7,7,658
no slow down,0,28,3,3,137
24 too fast,0,211,10,10,137
and at the right distance the fortress does not seem to shoot,0,848,10,10,393
its alright well get it and well get it,0,53,4,4,181
w ok managed to hit that enemy ok this is kind of just the grind right here,0,404,7,7,267
p just bouncing off the fortress right now,0,50,2,2,17
p all right here we go,0,55,10,10,996
were at 5 vulnerability right now so that nice,0,34,2,2,72
thats a friendly but im just gunna run right into the,0,825,2,2,79
alright,0,28,2,2,73
