trying to shoot and stay clockwise,0,468,7,7,141
trying to slow down,0,46,1,1,295
p okay uhm so i cant slow down,0,50,1,1,3
control is a lot harder,0,46,1,1,308
no this is really hard to fly,0,33,9,9,821
friendly mine helps and we are spinning around within the hexagon just shooting him without any resistance at all,0,848,9,9,373
just moving up and down,0,411,9,9,133
p alright same shit,0,16,6,6,434
keep forgetting that it doesnt go diagonal at all,0,54,1,1,311
alright,0,16,2,2,137
turn turn turn turn turn,0,56,6,6,76
alright one dollar sign,0,54,3,3,346
literally flight path is impossible maybe itll be easier with joystick,0,20,4,4,534
p alright the d a and q,0,848,6,6,317
alright now i know how i gotta stick a move okay i gotta stick a move,0,16,2,2,130
one thing i noticed is it shoots you right as soon as you start so you start with negative points,0,685,5,5,96
oh man so theres no way of slowing it down,0,211,3,3,39
stupid space fortress,0,52,7,7,736
i have lost track of the money right now,0,34,2,2,88
control of the joystick is a lot harder than the keyboard,0,788,4,4,175
p alright lets try this again,0,29,5,5,463
alright lets try ti get the 10 shot,0,910,4,4,102
i have a few strategies one i tried to keep it in the same line and let it go into hyperspace and just aim to shoot but,0,432,2,2,146
ah mumbles got out of control about to get nailed by the fortress shot,0,404,6,6,233
i wrote the flight path that i wanted to do but this is not working,0,20,1,1,410
alright right now we are staying within the borders of the uh fortress in order to try and boost our control points before we  we were at 9 vulnerability points and the fortress destroyed us,0,848,8,8,354
seem to keep going into hyperspace so jd thats a friend,0,34,3,3,138
alright do i just go on to the next one,0,51,1,1,20
this thing move quick,0,16,1,1,14
alright well destroyed the fortress once time,0,404,8,8,327
alright where that shit at,0,16,5,5,362
okay lemmy move out the way,0,16,1,1,31
okay going way too fast,0,818,5,5,111
alright,0,28,4,4,170
alright turn turn turn turn,0,210,6,6,83
p ok alright,0,404,5,5,206
controls just dont matter anymore,0,14,2,2,501
ill get some bonus right now nice,0,20,2,2,461
like hey yea i got this and actually like flies circles around and actually like defeats it,0,53,4,4,171
alright lemmy learn how to move while i okay,0,16,8,8,673
i think the next time i play this game its going to switch the controls on me,0,53,1,1,32
ok so i feel like im just turning the ship and i dont know how to actually um like move it forward,0,468,1,1,7
so with the mines its better to shoot them right away then check while youre shooting to see whether or not theyre enemy or friendly and if they are enemy then take down the defenses and if theyre friendly you already shot them,0,681,6,6,285
ah knew that was gonna happen i was right that was friendly didnt have time to look at the iff there either,0,404,9,9,354
alright,0,685,2,2,31
got hit right away,0,46,7,7,489
gonna try to start controlling the ship a little bit more,0,404,4,4,137
alright my score went down again thats always promising,0,558,5,5,39
its spinning in circles the whole entire,0,52,2,2,518
the space ship,0,130,8,8,378
now im gonna start focusing on i guess that well staying in the control zone,0,404,10,10,368
turn,0,51,5,5,163
okay well i cant get the interval right now but there we go,0,34,8,8,391
forward,0,55,3,3,651
p ok so im trying to control the uh ship and im playing the joystick controls not very well,0,468,1,1,3
stop,0,51,6,6,177
so we got 2 shots right now,0,34,5,5,243
yep alright,0,30,7,7,370
p oh ok alright,0,404,7,7,274
i got to slow down,0,34,7,7,334
i expected to go faster,0,46,7,7,486
p so up thrust,0,52,2,2,473
one come on slow down slow down,0,53,7,7,297
slowly,0,56,10,10,181
alright im out one,0,16,6,6,490
dog i cannot turn for shit,0,16,9,9,700
left,0,910,1,1,17
alright thats round 4,0,825,4,4,154
its a little easier to know to stop your rotation,0,685,7,7,146
oh alright then i have to pay attention i have to pay attention to that a little bit more,0,825,4,4,139
ok trying to stay back in control,0,404,4,4,164
the closer i get to it the control zone is very hard to stay in because i get hit pretty fast,0,404,4,4,160
money sign left click bonus,0,681,8,8,304
pu and f well hyperspace is going to help me get a away,0,34,10,10,456
p ah alright,0,20,2,2,421
alright,0,28,1,1,4
alright,0,16,3,3,177
okay hit thei have terrible movement,0,468,9,9,202
oh woops the speed has to do with how fast you kill the mines i was thinking of velocity but velocity was better in that game,0,848,4,4,291
p full game mumbles rules that are written on screen,0,53,6,6,242
so i got one more hit left,0,34,6,6,313
right,0,57,4,4,1033
slow down,0,51,7,7,286
so take care of that then i guess not slowly get into position were just gonna die,0,14,6,6,687
come on alright bad,0,16,3,3,238
alright,0,16,8,8,610
okay thats 1 down probably the fastest ill ever do it 1 got the missile 2 3 4 almost 5 you are t you are nothing important,0,825,6,6,190
i pretty much have to hit it two more times right,0,404,5,5,209
rotate,0,300,1,1,250
ah i never get away fast enough so it doesnt hit me,0,113,7,7,460
so i have to turn that into a,0,52,1,1,439
gentle movements,0,52,2,2,526
i cant control myself,0,16,3,3,252
okay score is slowly going up,0,681,3,3,249
p i keep flying outside of the hexagon which is making me lose points which isnt good,0,45,2,2,12
gotta say this mumbles clockwise,0,28,6,6,253
move forward,0,57,1,1,751
alright definitely not getting the once youre staying in lines,0,468,1,1,13
alright slow down,0,16,1,1,19
alright i gotta turn than move,0,16,6,6,445
alright,0,190,3,3,162
trying to slow back down mumbles,0,848,3,3,274
okay so i have to be in control,0,57,7,7,1200
uh the vulnerability of the fortress is at 11 right now and hopefully i can get a good  i got the shot off before i was able to destroy it,0,848,2,2,256
that doesnt stop moving,0,20,1,1,393
i cant get a control of it,0,210,1,1,5
turn turn turn,0,127,10,10,288
oh man that was right,0,30,9,9,484
i hit the left mouse button instead of the right,0,319,3,3,66
f alright just gonna let it hit me,0,681,2,2,237
p alright,0,26,1,1,10
get control,0,319,4,4,101
if you go super slow you make yourself vulnerable to the fortress and the mines,0,12,1,1,366
ok well i hope i get rid of all the negative points but i have expiring negative shots i cant slow down to whatever,0,569,6,6,209
q which is an unfriendly mine ok i just gotta hit it at the right interval,0,404,5,5,184
okay no control,0,818,6,6,128
alright that was probably pretty bad,0,190,6,6,193
slow down,0,51,8,8,315
gentle movements,0,52,2,2,525
go forward,0,55,7,7,875
please stop do,0,57,9,9,1383
okay turn around and got his way,0,56,8,8,114
go forward,0,20,1,1,403
go right,0,20,7,7,654
okay go forward,0,28,5,5,220
flying in circles,0,20,6,6,634
alright just a bonus once dollar sign pops up again got it alright points bonus,0,404,9,9,357
mumbles i got 3 4 4 alright still 4,0,372,5,5,68
slow down again,0,300,5,5,322
alright,0,16,3,3,211
ok slow down,0,569,3,3,176
alright,0,825,3,3,98
p so the controls have not switched up on me,0,53,9,9,397
turn and move,0,28,10,10,417
alright come on,0,16,8,8,630
its very difficult to get the rest of the game down until you learn to fly the thing thats the way i see it,0,127,2,2,208
ill probably get a good control score,0,825,10,10,300
alright im driftin lets get it,0,16,6,6,471
going a little slow,0,46,5,5,411
control control control,0,404,10,10,375
p alright the foe mines are y f and q,0,848,8,8,352
alright woah woah where are you going,0,53,5,5,218
get back inside the hexagon,0,300,7,7,370
these tight ass turns,0,16,5,5,388
first dollar sign there we go 38 shots left,0,130,10,10,432
no turn turn turn turn like that turn,0,113,1,1,326
alright lets ride,0,16,9,9,731
the optimal flight pattern that i had initially thought of is not the one im taking,0,12,2,2,411
alright,0,28,4,4,177
alright come on,0,16,10,10,807
alright the only way im going to win this is if i have the mine on my side,0,20,4,4,543
getting out of control first time i see the dollar sign friendly mine also on the screen,0,319,6,6,145
i kind of assumed that if i move my ship to the right that it would automatically go on a trail to the hold on like to the right but it does not,0,558,2,2,10
since the movement is so hard,0,12,5,5,520
p alright that was really frustrating because it kind of got stuck in an endless loop in between both sides,0,558,3,3,15
a meteorite flew right into it,0,127,10,10,290
lets take bonus points because i need all the help i can get really trying to slow down here,0,41,1,1,383
alright its like nope,0,647,2,2,162
forward,0,51,8,8,340
if i rotate slow enough i can get it,0,55,10,10,1038
forward,0,57,3,3,892
alright,0,319,2,2,28
so try to stasy in the hexagon but thats really hard tot do,0,12,1,1,346
alright were fine,0,33,3,3,542
one dollar sign move a little faster second dollar sign,0,14,10,10,846
and im out of control,0,28,8,8,341
slow down,0,454,6,6,212
i mumbles stop think about it,0,57,9,9,1408
slow interval and shoot,0,28,10,10,445
cant go backwards,0,51,6,6,224
alright,0,113,5,5,408
p okay so i think the main thing is to try to not get into hyperspace,0,468,1,1,10
slow down,0,51,10,10,422
forward rotating,0,300,4,4,311
oh no i feel like i might lose sanity for a bit just briefly,0,825,3,3,110
the mines go very fast as well,0,24,1,1,24
alright,0,788,6,6,182
set moving counterclockwise bwe thats a friendly shoot that one,0,910,1,1,15
thats too fast,0,12,6,6,558
so this is it is very hard to control,0,848,1,1,222
p youre right,0,3,3,3,53
ugh alright,0,473,7,7,301
no thats an enemy but i pressed it too fast,0,12,5,5,517
qcu qcu right click,0,52,10,10,868
efh gotta right that right click that and kill it,0,52,2,2,507
say in bounds,0,57,3,3,951
okay oh my god im going way too fast,0,818,1,1,13
slow down,0,28,2,2,105
flying off in random directions,0,14,9,9,831
dr and n right click,0,52,5,5,627
moving a bit fast dont like it dont like it dont like it,0,14,4,4,595
turn a little,0,57,3,3,891
turn and no,0,28,7,7,301
p lyv this is whether or not a mine is a foe so if it shows up on the iff counter at the bottom of the screen i have to if its one of those letters then it is a foe,0,681,1,1,188
aright shot,0,16,3,3,189
alright,0,16,2,2,141
p yeah this is my favorite strategy you lose points control wise but you make them back staying the hexagon half the time,0,977,6,6,96
okay move forward a little,0,57,4,4,1025
um this is very hard to control,0,739,1,1,9
p feel like im getting way more of a hang on these controls,0,400,6,6,130
well i got the interval right but i could not hit it,0,804,10,10,408
cant keep control of the ship but this is hard,0,804,2,2,252
alright,0,28,9,9,381
turn around aw man,0,818,10,10,253
alright go this way,0,51,3,3,58
second dollar sign going too fast,0,319,8,8,193
you know what were just gonna keep moving,0,14,3,3,550
nope mumbles alright,0,739,10,10,102
and its very frustrating because i cant control it the way i know i should be able to,0,127,5,5,245
im trying to control in this and im having a very hard time,0,20,1,1,390
p am i still using space bar,0,46,1,1,285
i almost went backwards maybe i did just slightly go backwards go backwards,0,155,2,2,201
just stay in the circle,0,51,4,4,103
i cant even slow this down,0,51,1,1,10
slow it down,0,28,5,5,208
now its aww man i couldve just fly out and get a second pass,0,57,9,9,1424
alright destroyed the fortress i have positive points finally i got 310,0,372,8,8,99
flying backwards,0,30,9,9,515
slowed down too much,0,3,6,6,112
g unfriendly ah im out of control ah man ok,0,404,10,10,379
in the hexagon,0,28,1,1,43
32 shots left continuing,0,910,4,4,108
get my moving down get my moving down,0,16,1,1,67
right click,0,52,10,10,863
i got the interval right but i didnt shoot it,0,24,3,3,87
slow down dude,0,53,1,1,29
alright box,0,16,2,2,101
wrapped the screen way too many times,0,319,7,7,187
p i still have 2 games left to play 3,0,685,8,8,163
cant control my speed so,0,910,5,5,125
the concept is simple but the controls are another story,0,804,2,2,255
slow your speed,0,51,6,6,180
and there you go i was right i dont know why i turned this like this maybe this is better,0,41,1,1,388
96 shots left,0,26,4,4,54
slow down slow down,0,28,1,1,24
i need to get moving so i dont get shot at,0,14,1,1,467
gimme that right back,0,16,6,6,452
p rzl for any and all ending in r oh iots so fast,0,12,1,1,343
26 shots left,0,26,3,3,31
i intended to avoid spardic flight pattens,0,12,6,6,551
to the right,0,818,6,6,121
thats a friendly mine but im moving really fast so i dont know if i can shoot it,0,3,7,7,122
i keep forgetting that the flight path is,0,54,5,5,375
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,6,6,466
its taking off velocity points,0,46,5,5,426
come on man how fast i gotta click,0,16,7,7,540
oh no i have to be inbounds i think,0,57,8,8,1339
stop doing that,0,51,4,4,97
gosh its like out of control,0,127,10,10,286
slightly forwards,0,55,3,3,657
alright we have to wait 250 milliseconds before each shot,0,20,5,5,566
i have lost all control at this point im just flying off now,0,14,3,3,559
at least this way i can get a little bit better get a feel for alright come on go,0,127,1,1,193
turn,0,51,5,5,160
just wrap the screen,0,432,3,3,161
alright k thats friendly,0,404,8,8,320
gotts stick and move stick and move,0,16,5,5,432
its just a lot of things like if i was just flying around and shooting i would be fine its just like im trying to look at the freaking reader and stuff and its just a lot i dont really know what you are and i have to remember it in my head but its not working,0,113,8,8,474
come on left hand,0,16,4,4,263
its frustrating i have to play with my left hand,0,658,6,6,54
alright here we go,0,28,1,1,53
alright im only on the ten point,0,16,8,8,656
so my screen warping is getting well better,0,825,3,3,125
alright so this is so annoying,0,113,4,4,396
as long as im moving ever so slightly i should umm,0,24,3,3,84
alright h,0,16,3,3,192
turn thrust,0,53,10,10,477
alright come on man,0,16,7,7,577
oh alright it repeats again,0,20,2,2,459
okay way to slow,0,34,2,2,101
no stop hitting me,0,14,4,4,603
i cant worry about the hexagon,0,432,3,3,159
i m choosing not to shoot right now because i dont have any bullets and i dont want to take negative points as im already doing,0,685,4,4,88
okay so 3 4 5 6 i dont wanna fly off,0,14,1,1,479
p im noticing im not really caring about the letters as much as staying in the circle,0,647,5,5,196
okay so im losing control,0,214,5,5,358
popped up right next to me,0,46,7,7,477
woah this is so hard to control,0,51,1,1,6
who says you need to go in circles to win,0,30,4,4,183
alright lets get it,0,16,3,3,250
i cant control this is killing me,0,404,1,1,39
im going to press the spacebar,0,20,1,1,385
alrighty come on fortress,0,454,3,3,171
p  alright you are going to stay on this bubble,0,113,9,9,492
forward,0,40,1,1,81
okay alright alright alright alright alright alright okay alright,0,113,2,2,336
its moving already,0,16,1,1,13
alright there we go,0,51,2,2,25
im gonna try it with the right hand,0,46,2,2,316
spinning around this thing its all about if youre going in one direction you press the thrust key,0,804,9,9,385
1 2 3 better control of the ship,0,647,4,4,191
going all over the screen,0,739,9,9,96
yup turn then move,0,16,6,6,447
just completely lost control may have died,0,818,2,2,31
alright alright alright,0,113,3,3,383
im just kinda going in circles,0,468,6,6,109
i cant never remember how fast i did these shoots,0,16,6,6,487
alright go forward,0,20,5,5,574
ive lost control this is when it gets bad,0,34,9,9,424
im not losing points for going to hyperspace but mumbles,0,468,4,4,48
i guess one of the things that i dont like is that it requires you to move in a pattern instead of just being able to fly around like you dont lose points if you fly around at least then you arent like more,0,411,9,9,136
p oh yea thats right i have to take care of the mines before i move on to the fortress,0,155,5,5,247
p i keep pulling it backwards but it doesnt work,0,50,2,2,18
slow down there,0,12,4,4,473
umm just trying to control the ship right now umm definitely definitely gaining some,0,468,6,6,102
cant shoot it too fast thats a friendly mine,0,404,2,2,75
alright come on come on,0,16,6,6,489
ah alright go around okay keep him there,0,210,3,3,36
gotta move a little bit faster,0,190,5,5,183
control,0,29,2,2,384
alright,0,51,7,7,285
p alright im trying to go in the counterclockwise flight path im like having trouble turning it,0,45,1,1,4
that was too fast,0,300,3,3,284
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1209
im pretty sure like with like the right control like 1000 points is definitely obtainable,0,825,5,5,160
left hand coordination is not working,0,46,4,4,383
alright trying to get into a good path,0,319,2,2,42
oops no no were gonna start flying around,0,818,5,5,92
alright go straight come on,0,210,6,6,82
right now i have 1000 which i think is just fantastic,0,558,1,1,5
its moving pretty fast,0,46,2,2,322
that thing follows me fast,0,51,3,3,71
alright oh wow youre an enemy,0,113,2,2,341
so the right speed is to keep going around in circles and not be shot at by the fortress but we still have mines we have to deal with which are q v and w for this game,0,848,10,10,394
alright,0,28,6,6,247
the less i turn i just i cant correct it not steer it,0,214,8,8,389
whats going on right now,0,739,4,4,42
alright,0,16,3,3,185
alright,0,16,4,4,342
turn and thrust turn and thrust,0,53,10,10,479
im in hyperspace getting followed by a mine which is definitely foe,0,468,6,6,111
as soon as you start the fortress gets hits on you for real like its just restarting up slow,0,804,3,3,258
so lets try to cancel out my normal points with the velocity points,0,34,10,10,483
and im going faster,0,411,6,6,98
damn every time i think i have the flight pattern down i dont,0,20,6,6,605
no left,0,51,10,10,428
and go forward,0,33,2,2,479
alright now lets try shooting at some stuff,0,28,1,1,38
just go slow,0,57,3,3,958
getting a little more control but unintelligible im not going to be doing so hot,0,804,6,6,306
unintelligible i just wish i wouldnt be going so fast,0,804,6,6,299
oh wait i think thats right,0,28,4,4,158
spacebar,0,54,9,9,436
i got a 9 right now,0,818,7,7,182
too slow,0,24,4,4,93
also moving the ship is kinda wonky it like requires you to turn it and accelerate it but the bad guy moves so much faster than you that its kinda hard to get a grip,0,411,9,9,140
its like the game knows when youre doing well and it just fires a thingy right at you,0,53,4,4,165
i gotta build up the vulnerability counter and try to move clockwise,0,681,1,1,194
im actually gaining hits on this thing ill get no control points but i think i can take the hit honestly how this game is so hard to control,0,404,2,2,83
going too fast going too fast,0,319,7,7,186
forward,0,55,5,5,762
mumbles clockwise mumbles alright,0,26,7,7,114
uhh yeah okay so same controls,0,53,4,4,142
inside the hexagon,0,49,9,9,478
p slow down slow down,0,50,4,4,48
slow slow and steady wins the race,0,30,3,3,142
so close slow down,0,825,4,4,143
going too fast going too fast,0,319,8,8,208
2 5 oh too fast dang it,0,211,10,10,132
oh enemy popped up right in my face,0,319,2,2,41
no stay out of hyperspace,0,818,7,7,164
alright thats it,0,16,8,8,635
p but you have to be inside the control zone,0,404,8,8,284
now im lost in hyperspace trying to gain control,0,468,7,7,144
actually the hardest thing is going forward,0,57,5,5,1042
nope im mustve did something right that time,0,20,10,10,801
theres a friendly on the screen,0,46,6,6,449
p im trying to go in the counterclockwise pathway but im struggling a little bit,0,45,1,1,5
so im staying my main strategy right now is to avoid the mine and im not staying in the hexagon very much because im trying to as much as i can but its hard,0,685,6,6,134
mumbles alright turn alright alright okay,0,113,3,3,375
alright,0,28,8,8,349
p oh right sorry,0,3,1,1,11
oh no turn and then thrust turn and then thrust,0,53,10,10,475
i dont like how it shoots me right awaythats all im saying,0,3,2,2,30
p now im going out of control,0,45,3,3,23
alright successful,0,825,4,4,147
p do you play left handed,0,569,1,1,152
okay you turn this way,0,113,3,3,372
see if i just screen wrap and kind of just stay in one horizontal err vertical line then that actually works pretty well for me,0,404,7,7,248
and a little bit forward,0,28,4,4,172
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1214
alright,0,16,3,3,219
if i could turn move move,0,57,10,10,1492
velocity is slightly faster than i would like,0,46,7,7,508
p oh ok alright,0,404,1,1,7
were gonna keep going to the right,0,818,8,8,202
p staying slow so far,0,300,8,8,373
come on move around,0,55,3,3,649
p center joystick top bottom thats right,0,53,3,3,93
circle around,0,319,2,2,34
i am getting close to 1200 so thats my goal right now,0,558,8,8,63
were just going to keep going to the right,0,818,5,5,87
okay im trying to control it,0,51,1,1,4
all right we have question mark,0,55,9,9,965
but i can just shoot that right yeah,0,52,6,6,673
slower slower,0,56,1,1,7
alright,0,28,5,5,228
cant waste this turn man i gotta learn how to move,0,16,8,8,676
im really just trying to get this thing to like allow me to control it but were not friends right now,0,47,1,1,8
alright whats next,0,16,4,4,324
turn turn,0,127,4,4,239
alright cool,0,28,8,8,359
alright buddy come on,0,568,3,3,65
you can only focus on one thing either destroying the mine or the fortress and then theres things shooting at you and then you have to think about not going into hyperdrive or hyperspace and the points and i dont even look at the points at times,0,53,7,7,310
turn around,0,57,7,7,1206
alright take my points and double shot,0,30,8,8,433
alright lemmy learn how to turn,0,16,4,4,274
umm its hard to control,0,372,1,1,4
managed to stay in the control zone a lot more,0,404,9,9,336
uh right 8,0,825,2,2,78
alright,0,558,10,10,76
umm but so i guess the what you were saying was like youre trying to accelerate in the,0,468,2,2,22
okay alright stop leaving stop leaving stop leaving the screen,0,113,4,4,388
back now inside the hexagon,0,300,6,6,340
keep trying to shoot too fast as well,0,12,3,3,439
slow down,0,51,5,5,150
alright,0,404,8,8,291
alright im at 10 again but im flying all over and i died,0,558,7,7,56
the screen went black,0,910,1,1,21
thats not the right key to fire,0,46,1,1,291
alright thats one,0,16,9,9,722
when it starts going too fast thats when it gets dangerous,0,34,7,7,333
right click that and i can kill it,0,52,3,3,541
im moving really fast,0,3,2,2,40
slow down,0,51,7,7,271
alright but i didnt get hit as much,0,16,4,4,341
go slower ok cool,0,211,8,8,113
alright i see what imma do,0,16,10,10,784
i think im going to track how fast it takes to shoot in between because it seems like it takes a break then shooting faster,0,400,2,2,112
its mhc here right now,0,404,8,8,326
i dint see the interval i think it was too fast,0,24,8,8,176
p slow down,0,50,9,9,111
im about to lose it so fast,0,155,5,5,242
basically alright im going to try this,0,51,2,2,36
slow down,0,51,6,6,216
alright,0,818,2,2,23
alright were gonna go out this way we can shoot now go straight clockwise he does not shoot you went youre going fast,0,818,1,1,12
cbe right click its gone,0,52,8,8,776
i swear the dollar sign appears right before im about to die,0,647,4,4,193
inaudible going way too fast but im outside the game ended,0,3,5,5,93
time my shots so theyre between the right millisecond intervals so it doesnt reset,0,681,1,1,199
getting too close to the edge keep moving,0,14,10,10,862
i could use that as a way to stop me,0,34,2,2,82
its kind of hard to keep out of hyperspace but oh the boss got me,0,804,2,2,247
yeah i definitely have to play the game like this at least 100 times just to get me in control of the space ship,0,127,1,1,195
i gotta get my muscle memory down as soon as i seen it to get the interval right,0,681,3,3,244
clockwise,0,54,5,5,376
alright thats two down,0,16,3,3,244
okay lets try to slow down here,0,14,6,6,705
alright,0,454,10,10,256
once you lose control its very hard to get it back,0,12,7,7,577
i should really stop starting to turn to try and get a cheap shot because im not going to turn fast enough to get a cheap shot,0,825,4,4,135
alright,0,568,1,1,15
turn,0,14,4,4,594
and slow down,0,28,8,8,344
going too fast,0,46,8,8,514
i can go forward,0,28,6,6,255
p yeah like sometimes its like harder to move around i dont think its the controls,0,211,6,6,84
alright we are almost there to destroy the fortress we are 7 currently,0,848,9,9,385
slow down,0,51,6,6,207
proabbly i stayed still too often to slow down,0,12,8,8,640
once i learn how to turn i swear ill get the game right,0,16,4,4,275
alright i should have got points instead of freaking shots,0,113,9,9,501
p k g y right,0,50,6,6,66
alright,0,319,1,1,8
alright well just r,0,16,3,3,240
your shipped wrapped around the screen 42 times,0,53,2,2,88
slow down,0,28,6,6,258
omg got it and then fortress which is right behind me,0,52,8,8,788
just flying all over the place,0,818,9,9,241
left click,0,51,6,6,220
first dollar sign going too fast,0,319,7,7,180
that was just too slow,0,432,5,5,173
go turn forward,0,28,6,6,239
shooting too fast thats a friendly mine,0,404,2,2,73
i gotta turn and boost turn boost turn boost turn boost turn boost,0,16,3,3,217
slow down,0,51,6,6,197
control control,0,454,5,5,199
alright uh,0,468,1,1,14
cbe right click no there not even mumbles cbe right click in the interval fire at it,0,52,8,8,787
alright,0,16,3,3,248
and its hard to go forward without going somewhere else at the same time,0,57,8,8,1347
so keep turn forward too much too much,0,28,2,2,100
slow down,0,51,7,7,234
alright lets go,0,685,3,3,46
i seem to do better when im moving because then the thing cant shoot me as much,0,54,5,5,392
alright were moving very slowly,0,28,2,2,99
trying the same strategy keep moving around,0,372,6,6,73
dont wrap the screen,0,51,6,6,191
p no like when i wrap the screen,0,211,7,7,102
yeah just keep going around in circles heh,0,113,2,2,359
ya know if i was good enough i could keep it in a circle that would be pretty cool,0,818,5,5,112
tryna avoid hyperspace now earlier in the game i wasnt,0,34,10,10,454
points is left,0,16,2,2,93
damn alright im just gonna ride,0,16,8,8,647
its hard to control it,0,54,4,4,357
forward,0,55,9,9,975
one bonus achieved still getting used to the controls since the ship does not slow down,0,804,3,3,259
p alright,0,647,10,10,245
lemmy slow down,0,16,1,1,17
mumbles go inside 50 36 shots left,0,26,9,9,153
mumbles clockwise,0,26,6,6,99
the speed is very hard to control but luckily we just got a second bonus or second dollar sign to receive the bonus,0,848,4,4,301
hold on slow down,0,56,7,7,94
keep hitting back on the control pad in order to stop the motion but i realize that it doesnt,0,404,2,2,77
i lost control of that,0,685,9,9,201
little circles,0,51,6,6,208
oh concentrate edgar like playing a mario game right now concentration is real,0,155,7,7,265
im in totally control i have relaxed everything in my body for some reason im not morphing out of control,0,825,8,8,246
control the ship,0,454,5,5,195
alright just uh huh,0,30,3,3,123
alright,0,404,7,7,247
i have 14 shots left i really need bonus shots,0,41,3,3,431
the trajectory,0,432,6,6,188
alright i got almost there,0,404,3,3,100
i lost control of it,0,788,3,3,164
mumbles thats a friendly mine right there,0,319,2,2,26
mine is on screen it is t,0,3,4,4,69
out of control,0,319,9,9,226
okay were just gonna keep going right,0,818,9,9,223
alright,0,454,2,2,160
alright gotta get a little bit faster,0,568,2,2,48
i wish when i moved to the right or the left it would go to the left or right,0,52,3,3,543
wow wow no no go in circles,0,113,10,10,525
rotate take my shots,0,14,2,2,521
cause most games now they like separate the direction from the moving,0,214,1,1,250
slow interval,0,28,10,10,450
the joystick is making it more confusing since i wanna go in the direction most free flowing but implementing is harder cause i wanna move forward,0,788,1,1,150
get control,0,454,2,2,161
its kind of off balance to control,0,210,1,1,9
dam those i thought i was slidin alright come on,0,16,5,5,380
get away from me personal space,0,53,10,10,495
its hard to stay in the hexagon,0,43,4,4,128
i think the best strategy ive figured out is just let it thrust one way and then just float and try not to get hit while you shoot the fortress,0,685,2,2,34
readjust move here,0,300,9,9,402
alright vulnerability 2 and he hit me thats enough,0,818,8,8,208
i was spinning around still trying to spin around the walls slowly just killed a mine so i was able to receive that vulnerability point,0,848,10,10,397
but due to my incredible maneuvering i cannot seem to line up a shot and the one time i do i seem to click it too rapidly which resets the vulnerability score so it is very frustrating,0,558,2,2,12
alright i just got killed,0,372,8,8,97
alright,0,28,4,4,166
turn around,0,57,7,7,1203
so we just circle around that,0,214,5,5,357
i mean once you get a good pace going its not too bad its just getting the thing under control is crazy,0,190,1,1,145
p umm im still like trying to get used to these controls cuz like sometimes when you try to turn to rotate it thrusts forward even though you dont intend to do that if that makes sense so sometimes it gets a little crazy,0,190,9,9,217
right click,0,52,5,5,623
now were going the right way,0,14,7,7,723
i know control vulnerability i forgot what interval means but its probably because i rarely hit a person,0,977,6,6,98
you geet used to everytime you respond you have to immediately move again,0,12,3,3,436
ok so i feel more in control of my actions and less of like i dont know whats going on but still trying to stay inside the lines,0,468,3,3,33
this could turn someone off to gaming completely,0,214,3,3,314
also slow down,0,12,3,3,453
four oh were moving now,0,20,4,4,530
and im flying all over the place,0,190,7,7,199
p ok ok thats right,0,411,1,1,4
forward,0,57,5,5,1061
basically lost control there,0,14,9,9,832
i think its actually impossible to fly in the circle,0,3,1,1,18
ok so i may not be staying in the middle as much as i want to but i definitely feel more in control of my movements,0,468,7,7,164
how do i move this over here,0,658,1,1,8
im waiting for the 250 millisecond interval and nothing alright,0,20,4,4,549
so once i get it under control mumbles take back,0,432,7,7,193
mumbling letters at beginning screen oqi oqi,0,404,5,5,176
alright jyq,0,16,5,5,347
okay oh okay now i understand so forward is forward and im just moving left and right  if i wanna decrease the speed i actually dont know how to do that,0,468,1,1,8
move in a straight line and shoot,0,300,2,2,275
alright qhd lets go,0,568,1,1,5
oops mumbles alright,0,319,2,2,43
two personal space,0,53,6,6,257
shot way to fast couldve gotten it,0,34,4,4,212
going extremely fast in this game,0,34,1,1,17
turn,0,28,6,6,271
maybe i should stay in here and try and move back,0,29,8,8,556
turn and slow down,0,28,3,3,136
alright,0,16,1,1,24
got hit right away,0,46,7,7,470
stay on the screen come on man,0,739,5,5,55
i need to start moving,0,14,5,5,631
getting used to the sensitivity but i completely expect that once the controls change it will be difficult all over again,0,12,3,3,451
get back into the hexagon,0,300,10,10,423
control the ship,0,454,3,3,169
slow it down,0,454,2,2,155
still cant control this thing,0,26,4,4,52
i guess the rotation is just so fast for me its difficult,0,127,6,6,258
and i have it right within what i need,0,34,4,4,166
turn around,0,28,2,2,74
turn,0,51,5,5,158
and hes moving faster than usual it seems like,0,20,3,3,474
move,0,55,3,3,654
trying to do this with my left hand is definitely hindering my point game,0,818,3,3,38
alright,0,825,1,1,11
p alright this time im finishing positive,0,16,5,5,345
control your speed,0,51,6,6,183
okay i didnt know that those mines could move,0,51,1,1,13
slow it down,0,28,5,5,207
p alright so lets youuu,0,28,3,3,122
rotate rotate rotate come on rotate go,0,127,1,1,197
p slow down bonus missiles,0,50,9,9,108
that velocity scored points are like nothing cause i keep dying,0,12,1,1,373
alright,0,16,8,8,613
actually even though if i stay it just for some reason starts putting me towards the hexagon,0,57,4,4,1022
alright,0,28,5,5,211
not even the dexterity of this but the fact that i dont do well lefthanded,0,127,3,3,229
im kind of spinning right now,0,468,8,8,179
but its harder to control because i cant pull up,0,41,1,1,363
alright same shit,0,16,9,9,685
alright this joystick,0,16,1,1,23
okay so now turn to me okay so that didnt work okay,0,113,4,4,401
it helps if i screen wrap but i know that messes with points oh see went to fast there,0,404,6,6,220
alright its getting a little easier now,0,685,7,7,153
i am going way to fast and it is tough right now,0,34,1,1,46
im able to stay in the control zone a little bit better this time,0,404,2,2,57
we are spinning out of control lets try and even it back out,0,848,1,1,232
okay were positive right now,0,34,4,4,163
clockwise position,0,300,6,6,339
this game is like slowly destroying my confidence at playing games,0,411,6,6,99
g into hyper space,0,14,9,9,805
i feel like im going fast,0,46,1,1,294
i was just staying in the hexagon how did i do that,0,52,3,3,565
nope no i just did a complete circle for some reason,0,818,6,6,138
slow down,0,51,7,7,254
ziu i wanna do that again slow down,0,41,6,6,497
im just flying in space not doing anything right now,0,372,1,1,7
all right good,0,55,6,6,806
i wasnt going too fast i stayed inside the hexagon flying maybe the wrong way but mumbles umm yeah so,0,468,5,5,82
ok mumbling alright got a friendly on the screen take him down ok,0,404,9,9,356
so weird trying to stay slow stay within the hexagon and just circle around the fortress it seems to have forgotten how to shoot,0,848,6,6,325
oh that is a friend alright alright,0,20,7,7,672
no turn,0,33,9,9,844
alright,0,28,9,9,385
im just trying to get the hang of the control,0,404,4,4,165
alright so i cant really stay in the,0,130,4,4,302
trying to control it,0,130,1,1,235
okay so my control was terrible,0,34,4,4,213
i was too slow on the interval that time to get the mine,0,681,3,3,247
is that two yep let me get those yeah right back,0,16,6,6,451
i tryinna slow down and shit,0,16,8,8,664
alright that is a d,0,16,6,6,442
speed a little too fast,0,46,7,7,471
i think oh didnt happen this time alright,0,558,3,3,16
getting used to the controls now,0,432,8,8,203
my ship wrapped around the screen 45 times,0,658,1,1,19
forward,0,55,3,3,656
dangit i keep flying right into him,0,16,4,4,314
slow down,0,51,7,7,282
alright,0,26,3,3,21
slow across the screen straight,0,300,10,10,421
the fort moves slower than i do,0,12,2,2,408
okay now im movin way too fast,0,16,2,2,168
so lets turn,0,54,3,3,352
and turn again,0,28,2,2,76
uh its getting out the screen,0,739,10,10,104
moving too fast again,0,12,2,2,416
trying to slow down,0,130,8,8,361
lets see right now im just trying to decelerate by going in the opposite direction but its really hard,0,130,5,5,306
like i dont know some people cut their steak with their right hand and then they switch hands to like scoop rice or whatever,0,53,4,4,159
its almost impossible to go slow,0,24,1,1,20
thrust left right,0,16,2,2,97
im going backwards,0,468,4,4,52
move,0,14,1,1,468
space fortress is mumbles enemy mine,0,319,7,7,175
alruight right right,0,20,7,7,653
its not like when you get hit by the missiles and the screen starts but its like the mine hits you it freezes,0,818,6,6,133
too slow,0,41,9,9,604
i have no control whatsoever,0,804,6,6,304
but if my theory still proves true as soon as i get the hang of this theyll switch the controls on me,0,53,4,4,184
alright so bouncing off the middle seems to send me in the opposite direction so its not a good way to slow me down,0,468,8,8,178
ah turn turn turn turn  mumbling,0,210,4,4,43
slow slow ah of course,0,53,4,4,164
its just so hard to keep up with everything at the bottom because it changes so much the game just moves so quickly,0,211,9,9,129
p alright good maybe ill get a little better,0,685,1,1,23
i only got 13 shots left,0,54,4,4,362
alright heres the thing,0,28,2,2,67
okay were at 5 right now,0,34,5,5,241
alright alright alright,0,113,10,10,523
x friendly mine try to shoot it alright just hit it,0,404,7,7,268
that hexagon,0,52,10,10,893
alright mine down,0,28,5,5,213
p alright alright oh this is not easier not at all,0,113,1,1,309
definitely try tookay already going counterclockwise,0,468,8,8,188
alright this is very sensitive,0,28,2,2,96
alright get the points,0,51,10,10,453
i wish backwards could do something,0,52,4,4,578
oh i am clicking too slow on the intervals with the enemy enemy mines,0,404,7,7,256
hey alright mumbles,0,30,6,6,291
right,0,26,2,2,13
alright i it was ezekiel so thats a friend,0,20,8,8,707
lemmy rotate to it,0,14,7,7,748
stops game,0,739,1,1,5
its very slippery im staying outside of the control line a lot which is very difficult to stay in and when it starts immediately and the fortress gets off the first shot that i really cannot avoid,0,404,1,1,21
oh too fast there we go,0,211,1,1,10
i shot too fast that time i can tell,0,12,2,2,392
and it seems to be just the right speed for the bullets to not be able to hit me unless directly facing the fortress,0,848,5,5,310
actually managing to get off a lot of shots im at 6 right now,0,404,3,3,114
just one time just one time just go fast,0,155,1,1,191
turn then move,0,16,6,6,498
were flying off to fast too fast,0,14,6,6,703
right click shoot at it,0,52,2,2,519
so much for control points,0,12,6,6,541
turn around bang,0,20,8,8,721
i think the shots are based how fast you move vertically,0,400,3,3,119
okay screen just went black,0,34,1,1,50
p the directions for moving the ship sound a lot easier than they do on paper,0,977,2,2,83
p alright hit me,0,33,2,2,455
p  ok same controls,0,53,5,5,194
im getting better at identifying the foes and double clicking the correct time interval and i just took the points and i shouldve took the shots because i only have 3 left,0,685,9,9,197
alright theres the bonus 1 bonus 2 for the points,0,404,10,10,385
damn these shits movin faster,0,16,5,5,424
turn around,0,127,7,7,265
mmm if i go too fast it doesnt even shoot at me so thats good,0,404,10,10,384
aright im probably having a harder time with this,0,38,1,1,154
i definitely feel like if it was more of like an arcade stick with buttons it would be easy but this joystick is not the right thing for it this is for like planes,0,217,2,2,66
slow down,0,46,8,8,516
p i just dont remember if its right,0,3,3,3,56
alright you my friend,0,16,3,3,193
trying to avoid this hyper space is harder than i thought,0,210,6,6,81
ive been getting the most points for control really,0,12,5,5,536
i have no control over this,0,29,9,9,583
okay trying trying to go slowly,0,24,1,1,39
uh how does it expect you to stay within the circle,0,825,3,3,101
you cant kill it if theres a mine on the screen,0,130,5,5,309
no that was left alright,0,20,7,7,681
right away speeds a little too fast,0,46,6,6,440
i aint cluch with the right clicks,0,16,9,9,750
haha i think my ultimate strategy here is to really not even worry about the control zone because it is so hard to stay in,0,404,2,2,78
if i actually ended up flying a plane,0,113,7,7,469
alright i still got my points,0,16,9,9,730
hyperspace someone is following me,0,468,8,8,187
turn and go,0,28,7,7,313
p stay inside this hexagon,0,50,6,6,64
perfect we got a good velocity that hes not shooting for some reason,0,848,9,9,372
p alright,0,739,1,1,6
uh i cant even keep it on the screen,0,739,2,2,26
alright come on,0,16,9,9,701
lemmy get this moving down,0,16,1,1,45
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,6,6,438
alright so im going to fast and i need to control that,0,54,3,3,351
turn it yea yea,0,214,5,5,349
i need to learn how to move,0,16,8,8,654
going too fast going too fast,0,319,9,9,221
circles will not get me wins,0,30,5,5,257
no i was too slow,0,34,3,3,124
alright so its supposed to be a long wait then,0,16,9,9,745
um slow slow hey,0,53,4,4,166
alright camera help me memorize that,0,49,7,7,401
tries to shoot slowly,0,300,8,8,381
p alright,0,190,8,8,214
alright onf alright i can do that,0,16,1,1,8
i can also feel the snap back if you dont position the joystick back to neutral like a game controller,0,468,3,3,38
turn,0,33,10,10,856
alright friendly mine,0,28,5,5,215
slow down,0,51,3,3,73
i have to go in a different direction to go slower,0,57,3,3,927
slow down,0,300,4,4,310
alright o thats a friendly,0,404,10,10,386
hyperspace,0,28,4,4,176
going too fast i see the dollar sign and an enemy mine,0,319,7,7,168
alright alright alright,0,404,6,6,240
figuring out which way to turn is like i think thats an enemy mine we can shoot it,0,130,1,1,241
so now im just going to try to fly around and avoid everything so i can get shots,0,685,9,9,198
straight straight left ok straight oh that didnt work out,0,20,7,7,673
oh slow,0,28,7,7,305
its just its just i cant get any type of control,0,57,9,9,1376
slow down,0,51,9,9,366
no were just gonna lose complete control,0,818,7,7,184
alright i might as well just use my shit,0,16,4,4,296
im supposed to be staying in the hexagon,0,20,3,3,509
alright ok oh no,0,53,2,2,70
alright that was all ten,0,30,10,10,585
im slow at distance,0,300,10,10,417
okay this is not working right,0,113,5,5,426
trying to slow that down,0,130,2,2,248
its just that nothing really comes to mind other than trying to move,0,910,1,1,14
stop,0,24,1,1,40
i got to walk faster,0,432,1,1,140
learn how to move,0,16,8,8,671
come on go forward,0,55,2,2,603
okay not doing too hot on this one on velocity or anything either,0,34,10,10,477
just control,0,300,2,2,278
mumbles alright and sometimes you just go too slow,0,190,9,9,218
and then once i got the hang of it i got to shoot it i need to just stay inside the hexagon,0,130,5,5,316
slower and clockwise,0,28,8,8,350
tqj alright yes,0,404,4,4,136
fik so fast,0,130,9,9,400
slow down going way to fast,0,34,4,4,203
oh that was my worst score right there,0,558,10,10,77
slow down,0,53,2,2,69
slow down,0,51,9,9,371
its like trying to go slow and steady now just messes you up,0,411,5,5,77
p so this is nothing right here txh,0,26,1,1,3
you know i havent been looking at the interval thing i just hope i got it right,0,400,4,4,123
p trying to keep a handle on the control there,0,210,1,1,8
alright nice fire fire,0,20,2,2,426
its so risky to slow down,0,12,2,2,406
turn,0,28,1,1,28
go straight make a left,0,20,7,7,655
alright so i think i got a strategy going,0,568,3,3,68
shoot okay alright umm i think im starting to get a little better doing the thrusting and all that stuff trying to keep it on the screen a little bit better,0,685,1,1,18
im going a bit too fast right now but you know live and learn,0,41,8,8,576
alright 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 destroyed it,0,372,6,6,76
turn turn,0,127,10,10,289
forward,0,57,3,3,911
turn and move,0,16,4,4,277
so we are going to try and mimic what we did last game and slowly spinning within the hexagon basically the purpose of the game,0,848,10,10,392
okay thats fast,0,51,3,3,59
you can kinda gat a clue its hard to notice when youre in hyper space,0,977,9,9,113
go this way alright go this way alright alright no stop stop,0,113,2,2,352
oh out of control now,0,319,3,3,54
alright three minutes its done,0,53,10,10,498
okay clockwise not too fast i could probably do a lot better with my right hand but yes shoot it,0,818,2,2,18
slow slow down,0,404,4,4,145
alright this is a little bit easier to control,0,372,2,2,22
control is negative but that was really bad,0,46,7,7,509
thats weird i didnt notice the fortress was spinning within the octagon or hexagon whatever,0,211,5,5,69
ah alright so if i boom boom boom,0,20,4,4,517
when i try to go forward it almost goes left as well,0,57,2,2,794
mumblesalright,0,788,1,1,148
or stop missing,0,3,7,7,139
i need to turn,0,33,9,9,831
mumbles see im out of control now,0,404,4,4,163
i seem to be losing a lot of control points,0,34,5,5,250
move alright,0,910,1,1,18
alright,0,16,1,1,44
i was thinking yea move forward and then no,0,214,5,5,356
okay so for this one im just going to try and wrap the screen as many times as possible and just shoot when i have the opportunity,0,372,5,5,58
at 5 vulnerability friendly mine right there,0,319,2,2,29
there we go and now just turn and a little bit of speed,0,51,2,2,38
forward,0,57,3,3,889
i think im right bro,0,49,9,9,461
and i dont know how much times left,0,685,10,10,225
kay too fast too fast too fast okay were just gonna keep going this way,0,14,7,7,743
i am at 478 right now only 61 shots left,0,372,3,3,41
we have 1 2 3 4 5 so hard to like gain control after you lose it,0,647,7,7,223
because i was doing the thing too slow i need to get between the things,0,41,7,7,521
p ok my question is i might just not umm been hitting the enemy fortress but once i got to ten i was trying to hit it with two shots and uh it seemed to be going right through it,0,404,5,5,192
alright,0,404,8,8,304
slow down a bit,0,34,9,9,439
yeah i think that my problem is that i prioritize it trying to stay on the screen so the mouse doesnt factor into this for me,0,47,3,3,34
p yeah like maybe i should try shooting some more but just wanna get the control thing first down so you like,0,468,3,3,44
gotta try to develop my strategy on the go im not worried about control until that last hit i guess,0,404,5,5,203
turn and go,0,28,2,2,98
p i gotta use my left hand,0,16,4,4,261
lost a lot on control and velocity,0,46,6,6,466
okay so doing good on velocity,0,34,9,9,434
alright,0,28,10,10,435
p yeah umm i wrapped the screen 32 times definitely better upgrade,0,568,2,2,53
trying to get a hang of the controls first,0,681,1,1,204
alright im gonna do this,0,404,7,7,245
and i still cant control this ship because it has a mind of its own,0,20,1,1,399
well were doing good in points right now which is good,0,34,9,9,415
i cant get into the circle,0,38,3,3,182
oh fly this way,0,20,5,5,569
its like a slow time on the mumbles i dont think ive destroyed this thing once,0,432,2,2,151
counterclockwise huh maybe i was wrong,0,53,3,3,94
slow oh alright,0,30,3,3,143
moving it there,0,300,8,8,382
alright off to a bad start,0,155,10,10,296
alright,0,28,4,4,165
p definitely cant go clockwise as easy as i could,0,18,1,1,33
alright i have control now,0,825,8,8,245
well just slowly coast along,0,14,9,9,827
uh thats friendly but i cannot slow down enough to shoot it,0,3,5,5,80
i dont find myself caring about the hexagon anymore just focusing on the fortress,0,432,3,3,158
p alright alright come on,0,454,3,3,165
mine popped up right in front of me,0,55,1,1,520
focus and go back clockwise,0,300,7,7,359
i think i have better control on this one but the other is easier for shooting,0,18,7,7,43
i dont know how im supposed to shoot the means because im just freaking flying dumb flight path,0,20,3,3,502
im doing good with mines and going off the screen,0,51,5,5,172
this would be a lot easier i did not expect that to move like that,0,27,1,1,11
fast fast go around,0,210,4,4,45
come on go fly through come on fly through,0,127,2,2,206
okay left turn,0,27,1,1,10
at least i destroyed it its not fast this is good,0,211,9,9,125
p they keyboard felt more of a game and this feels like im just shooting makes me want to spam the shoot button cause of the way its moving its more precise,0,217,8,8,80
go go i think i have 61 shots left so i just need to somehow get the extra missiles,0,130,1,1,237
p alright here we go,0,47,6,6,80
i keep spinning instead of going forward,0,57,7,7,1223
we cannot lose these points right now,0,20,9,9,756
i love how it just wants you to fly around the hexagon but like yea no,0,53,1,1,25
its a lot faster paced than i thought it would be for sure,0,404,1,1,26
alright,0,454,2,2,143
p i keep pulling backwards on the joystick even though it doesnt work,0,50,7,7,82
i cant really slow down and now i can,0,569,6,6,204
oh no too fast too fast,0,818,4,4,75
back to the controlling thing forward on the joystick is still move forward even when youre ship is pointed in every direction because it doesnt make sense,0,977,10,10,117
i had the flight plan down but yeah it took a long time,0,20,10,10,810
turn around turn around make a right for forward,0,20,6,6,615
okay so if its lrg stop it,0,825,3,3,89
im really just going for control almost,0,404,5,5,187
p oh ok its moving very fast,0,211,1,1,3
going too fast,0,28,10,10,411
im more of a controller person,0,53,2,2,58
i just entered hyper,0,14,3,3,549
dang man i be movin too fast for me to shoot this thing,0,16,3,3,220
slow down,0,12,4,4,476
stay on the screen,0,739,7,7,74
alright i definitely just definitely energized that,0,404,1,1,34
alright r friendly mine got the hit,0,404,7,7,270
okay so im gonna float through space the quickest,0,113,1,1,317
so trying to go slower than usual and stay within the boundaries,0,848,5,5,306
looking slowly to the right,0,300,4,4,302
control the ship,0,454,5,5,191
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1210
im doing it too fast,0,52,5,5,666
i need to stop going into hyperspace,0,53,6,6,275
ive watched dragon ball z this is the easiest,0,825,8,8,234
wait ok i lost control,0,210,2,2,20
sorry didnt fly it,0,53,2,2,50
p slower slow,0,50,4,4,38
accelerating left,0,910,3,3,82
alright damn,0,16,2,2,161
p alright lets do this,0,568,3,3,60
forward ok,0,52,1,1,432
slow down,0,51,2,2,24
forward oh this is so difficult,0,52,1,1,434
im not moving forward anymore,0,788,2,2,156
no dont lose control yet,0,685,4,4,85
i dont like these controls already,0,14,1,1,448
alright come on come on come on come on,0,16,6,6,460
okay one shot left,0,29,6,6,511
i really dont know how to slow down and i cant seem to aim really at all,0,558,1,1,4
of course it hits me when i went into hyperspace i didnt know what was gonna come out there,0,804,10,10,400
alright it blacked out,0,210,1,1,13
you warped the screen 7 times,0,14,3,3,581
p alright,0,910,1,1,22
p alright bonus,0,51,10,10,396
oh i gotta slow down,0,34,2,2,65
alright lemmy go my other way,0,16,7,7,537
turn,0,56,4,4,50
uh t that didnt matter i just ran right into it,0,825,2,2,77
alright i really want to get the flight path down,0,20,3,3,498
oh right at 2 oh well,0,569,8,8,229
turn shoot,0,28,9,9,392
i need to learn how to control my velocity,0,51,2,2,34
slow down,0,51,3,3,56
p yeah that seems to be the best course here cause trying to go in a circle like it wants me to is just kinda frustrating,0,411,10,10,145
oh going too fast,0,319,4,4,81
alright here we go,0,28,10,10,409
my control has gotten a lot better,0,788,5,5,179
alright managed to hit the enemy got the vulnerability 1 vulnerability 2,0,404,7,7,254
one personal space two personal space,0,53,3,3,113
alright,0,372,9,9,114
i completely lost control,0,788,3,3,166
i was going too fast last time,0,130,2,2,245
too fast,0,12,6,6,563
unintelligible im getting bonus points because im not going into hyperspace that much,0,804,6,6,297
alright so how im onna do this,0,16,3,3,258
way too fast,0,46,6,6,455
turn then move,0,16,6,6,499
p the only thing is wrapping the screen i just cant really avoid it its one or the other if i cant control it then,0,404,4,4,122
forward,0,57,3,3,890
alright right now im just trying to not mumbles,0,468,1,1,12
okay im going way to fast with the speed,0,34,4,4,177
just trying to get control of the game,0,404,1,1,19
no cant control,0,210,6,6,88
gotta get control stop moving so fast,0,214,4,4,320
okay go forward,0,51,5,5,157
alright aw i thought i should aim,0,113,2,2,362
too fast,0,41,10,10,640
yeah another im going in circles outside of the lines,0,468,6,6,126
im trying to slow down,0,12,8,8,620
up turn,0,14,4,4,612
okay i gotta turn then move,0,16,6,6,497
13 shots left,0,26,5,5,81
ok that was right,0,411,3,3,38
ah moving pretty fast now i gotta slow down a bit,0,404,3,3,102
which means i have to go in a circle,0,29,6,6,512
next time i see the dollar buttons im going to click left,0,468,4,4,60
ah no trying to stay inside the hexagon,0,468,5,5,78
alright,0,825,2,2,51
that was too fast,0,788,3,3,165
first dollar sign and second one shots oh no that was too fast,0,130,1,1,239
oh i didnt know i was on top of the screen,0,113,9,9,498
enemy mine going way too fast,0,319,5,5,124
alright this oh oh,0,20,4,4,513
im on level 10 h too fast,0,211,8,8,112
not the right interval messed up going too fast,0,319,6,6,161
too fast,0,24,1,1,32
alright one dollar sign waiting for the next,0,20,4,4,539
mumbles out of control,0,319,4,4,105
d friendly im in a bad spot ah man im not going very fast but not slow either,0,404,6,6,234
alright,0,28,10,10,422
i need to control better,0,52,2,2,494
rotate and pass him by,0,300,2,2,274
it keeps stuttering a little bit sometimes which doesnt affect the play all that much but is kind of jarring when youre moving really fast and then you hit a mine and then the whole screen freezes,0,818,6,6,132
that was too fast,0,14,3,3,577
negative velocity points,0,46,5,5,427
p im dead right now,0,40,1,1,80
ohhh right on time,0,53,9,9,443
alright,0,28,5,5,224
go forward,0,51,5,5,159
alright,0,454,7,7,233
alright im gonna find a way to make this work,0,113,1,1,323
a lot faster than i thought it would be,0,910,1,1,5
i lost control,0,300,10,10,420
ive lost control right now,0,34,10,10,469
control the ship,0,454,6,6,208
alright fxd are the enemy mines,0,319,3,3,48
p okay umm so im just trying to control the ship right now im getting a tiny better but still not really able to go the other way but still  umm so yeah i think this will take some getting used to,0,468,2,2,19
no i have to move i cant just sabotage this,0,52,4,4,590
lemmy learn how to turn,0,16,4,4,287
im enjoying the fact that at least my spaceship goes like an actual airplane  its delightful to see,0,804,5,5,282
strategy of just flying randomly,0,30,3,3,139
it is so hard to stay in bounds,0,16,1,1,54
ok now start trying to control a little bit more,0,404,8,8,306
go forward,0,51,5,5,162
oh i just oh thats right because it totals all the scores,0,12,5,5,535
alright okay okay,0,28,5,5,200
this is much harder to control,0,14,1,1,444
alright,0,16,5,5,406
i cant slow down well that worked,0,569,5,5,198
alright were good now,0,33,6,6,661
cbe right click in the interval,0,52,8,8,751
its a bad one my interval was too fast no that was the second one,0,130,4,4,290
however my velocity is at 1,0,130,4,4,293
i dont care if i keep going into hyperspace i just need to get this vulnerability,0,34,3,3,147
this is going way too fast,0,739,1,1,10
p slow down slow down,0,50,10,10,133
im going way too fast,0,3,5,5,84
stay out of the bounds,0,47,10,10,136
no we just lost control again,0,818,8,8,212
gotta stop hitting that though,0,57,6,6,1148
moving better,0,214,7,7,379
if i could even control it at all,0,404,1,1,40
too fast too fast,0,56,4,4,49
let me just keep going to the right,0,818,8,8,209
turn,0,28,10,10,462
forward,0,57,7,7,1229
so keep moving and just fly straight into it thats,0,14,7,7,751
yep i was right dont need that,0,454,8,8,241
slightly slower than last time,0,46,2,2,327
stop stop,0,411,8,8,115
hyperspace,0,818,5,5,108
alright im not even worrying about direction at this point,0,411,6,6,97
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1211
turn,0,57,7,7,1212
this thing i just cant control it,0,127,7,7,262
its becoming a little somewhat easier to control unfortunately the fortress has been able to shoot me quite a few times,0,848,8,8,360
alright here we go,0,214,5,5,350
alright,0,28,5,5,206
p alright,0,190,8,8,207
almost got a full circle,0,739,9,9,98
move,0,20,10,10,809
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1213
apparently that friend was a foe so im just gonna keep going into hyperspace apparently since i cant just stay straight,0,804,10,10,406
omg qcu right click,0,52,10,10,862
dang turn turn turn turn dang,0,16,5,5,375
i should be able to hold it at a diagonal and that around thing in that hexagon but that is not been working for me,0,47,7,7,103
okay wow im losing so many points right now,0,34,7,7,358
slow down,0,51,7,7,287
alright were gonna do this whole thing,0,40,3,3,92
5 vulnerability 6 try to shoot it about once every time i wrap the screen,0,404,7,7,269
alright that motherfworder coming for me,0,16,10,10,756
that was the bonus okay move forward take the bonus shots,0,41,1,1,370
move move,0,30,1,1,37
any chance i could play this with my right hand,0,818,1,1,4
alright 5 hits on the vulnerability counter,0,372,2,2,31
ah interval or speed for my click was too fast and i died,0,685,3,3,62
its just im like i cant fly right and then the fortress and the mines are like they dont care you know,0,214,3,3,307
5 alright no darn it,0,825,3,3,116
gonna learn how to move,0,16,8,8,655
i must have went too fast or didnt react fast enough,0,12,9,9,653
right now i am trying to work with my old uh whats it called plan of spinning within the circle very slowly,0,848,2,2,248
moving too fast,0,12,4,4,479
its spinning so fast,0,211,2,2,24
its really hard to control this guy,0,47,2,2,21
p try to keep control here,0,50,10,10,123
yeah because even if i do control im not shooting anything,0,57,7,7,1219
im just going to go like that points up screen and its going to go up continuously,0,53,8,8,378
and it seems that sometimes he doesnt shoot me but sometimes he does like depending on where i am on the screen,0,47,10,10,145
p another important this is to move away when it first starts the game at least cause you get hit that first time,0,432,10,10,216
go forward,0,55,2,2,565
forward,0,55,7,7,872
p just trying to get the controls down,0,658,4,4,35
getting out of control,0,319,7,7,181
4 5 so fast now,0,211,10,10,139
more control i get over it the slower i move it and what ends up happening is i get hit by the enemy fortress,0,404,4,4,144
at least i mumbles alright i got like the same score,0,190,4,4,177
alright alright,0,28,2,2,71
alright a youre friendly and youre gone,0,825,6,6,187
slow down,0,51,7,7,255
im getting the control down a lot more right as i say that i kind of get out of control there,0,404,9,9,353
dont judge me on my knowledge of quails,0,53,10,10,468
right click interval,0,52,4,4,610
alright,0,16,7,7,575
going too fast,0,46,9,9,568
p alright,0,910,1,1,13
p im trying to slow this ship down and tilt it a little bit forward but it keeps going faster which really sucks,0,411,4,4,53
all right,0,57,7,7,1259
get away from me you stupid minewowalright howd i do,0,155,8,8,276
turn turn,0,57,3,3,913
p oh ok right,0,190,6,6,189
alright so now we are in position for flying off into a random direction,0,14,1,1,470
shed probably cry right now oh my god i cant stop thinking about that,0,214,2,2,282
ok take it slowly there you go nope come back,0,210,5,5,51
get this one game right,0,16,8,8,657
14 shots left,0,26,3,3,39
p if you try and keep track of reading the scorecard at the bottom like the control and velocity and you take your concentration off the game for a second it feels like you have for minutes theres some rounds like this one where you hope you die because its a lost cause and want to start over,0,977,4,4,91
okay i wrapped around the ship screen less times and i was damaged more times,0,55,2,2,609
alright all done,0,190,10,10,229
stop moving stop moving,0,16,4,4,308
too fast too fast too fast too fast,0,14,2,2,509
alright,0,28,1,1,44
if i can control this ting im just going in circles,0,569,8,8,230
oh theres a mine on screen i think its friendly,0,3,10,10,226
when i see that on the screen i double right click,0,52,2,2,478
okay so right now friend okay,0,34,1,1,22
cant seem to get it to go right,0,804,3,3,260
slow down,0,51,6,6,201
it feels like the joystick is moving up but i dont know,0,788,1,1,151
umm ah back in hyperspace,0,468,7,7,149
alright,0,319,4,4,79
p okay i keep losing control almost immediately and i am having a lot of trouble slowing down,0,558,4,4,19
mumbles alright,0,26,6,6,97
your ship warped through the screen 29 times,0,825,1,1,42
p okay its pretty hard just feel like umm just doing this with my left hand is pretty difficult,0,319,1,1,5
turn toward,0,28,7,7,290
yep alright okay cool,0,30,8,8,418
i got it right there,0,16,1,1,73
get some decent points velocity,0,46,9,9,590
turn,0,28,2,2,80
well the mines move really fairly slow enough to react if youre not flying into hyperspace,0,12,2,2,399
the hardest part i think as well is not wrapping around the screen because it makes it easier but you lose points by doing that,0,685,2,2,41
i even drew a flight pattern i knew when to turn,0,53,10,10,480
and move out of my way,0,14,2,2,524
bad mine kill it there we go no slow down 37 more bullets,0,130,8,8,371
um just getting a lot more control of my ship,0,404,4,4,143
p alright,0,155,10,10,297
okay were at 3 right now which is nice,0,34,4,4,199
the controls are really the hardest part im having a hard part controlling the ship at all much less worrying about the mines,0,404,1,1,27
i like this speed right here,0,647,2,2,156
flying myself down,0,300,2,2,260
but there are good people playing you join in as a beginnger and theres no space for you and you get discouraged cause these guys are kicking your butt,0,214,3,3,312
alright,0,28,1,1,19
okay move there we go,0,910,2,2,40
still gotta get the interval timing right to identify the mines,0,681,5,5,275
okay alright,0,113,8,8,486
alright slow down x6 babe,0,454,2,2,156
control,0,454,5,5,193
okay slow down,0,51,8,8,334
whoa whoa whoa bro bro bro too fast slow down,0,155,4,4,226
p at the moment it feels like my thoughts are like just how to get around how do i turn like how do i keep straight how do i um do this or do that like,0,825,1,1,23
alright come on lets go,0,568,2,2,40
alright,0,16,5,5,360
slow down,0,51,3,3,74
alright go right go that way go backwards,0,20,5,5,580
slowing down is extremely  difficult so its better to go at an optimal speed constantly or just very slow constatntly,0,12,2,2,398
mumbles backward,0,57,4,4,1032
the iff button is the right button but i clicked the left button,0,468,6,6,114
turn go forward go forward there you go forward turn,0,210,5,5,55
its slowish i guess 4 5 friendly that i cant hit is that one or two dollar signs,0,14,6,6,706
i always look forward never look back,0,155,3,3,216
okay were back inside the hexagon,0,34,7,7,355
we just fly through this,0,57,6,6,1176
alright 1 now im going the other way,0,825,8,8,249
all right,0,57,10,10,1454
stop hitting the thing,0,24,6,6,129
slow down,0,51,8,8,303
so bjq there goes a dollar sign however im trying to stay in control oh god i took 2 bullets bjq its fine,0,130,7,7,338
come on stop choking,0,24,8,8,196
ok let me just get inside the control,0,404,9,9,359
alright here we go,0,28,6,6,248
trying to keep it on the screen,0,739,3,3,32
ah man going out of control here ok bonus if that pops up again im gonna hit it,0,404,10,10,377
p alright the foes are umh,0,372,2,2,21
15 shots left,0,26,10,10,172
dont go too fast,0,432,2,2,145
so i should stop missing,0,3,7,7,143
im not even staying in the circle,0,51,3,3,63
turn,0,28,3,3,141
alright this is im getting crazy with these controls,0,190,7,7,203
slow down,0,51,6,6,195
okay you know its easier to stay inside the octagon with this thing,0,41,1,1,374
ok now i got a little hang of it still kind of uncontrolled,0,210,2,2,22
alright what is this next one at,0,16,2,2,143
i pressed that too fast,0,12,4,4,487
trying to stay inside the hexagon but its really hard thats why my velocity is at 200,0,130,1,1,240
umm im doing a little bit better i think the control on this game is a lot better on this game than the other games and its the last game so i didnt expect it to be better,0,685,10,10,222
alright,0,404,5,5,177
oh i just realized that if its not a foe you cant even move the iff,0,57,10,10,1448
alright bet,0,16,5,5,429
im trying to concentrate more than anything right now,0,127,3,3,223
im surprised im negative 700 points right now,0,825,1,1,18
mumbles alright,0,568,1,1,16
just fly up fly up,0,30,9,9,495
oh lets get out of here and hyperspace,0,34,7,7,354
alright,0,16,5,5,359
once i have the ship flying on autopilot in my head i will get better at the game,0,681,1,1,213
no i didnt want to turn,0,33,9,9,846
turns out it was,0,41,1,1,379
we can sacrifice pointer control for velocity and points and see how that works,0,848,5,5,309
slow down,0,51,6,6,217
immeadiately moves and gets hit,0,12,3,3,452
let myself fly across,0,20,8,8,690
forward,0,57,3,3,916
z the interval im doing is too fast thats the first dollar sign zvg thats good,0,130,5,5,310
i am not what how do i there we go i slowed down and im dead,0,41,2,2,405
moving way too fast,0,3,9,9,178
i hate this e with a stick on it and how it goes in a circle it bothers me,0,113,10,10,527
p alright,0,685,1,1,20
got hit right off the bat,0,46,9,9,577
p im still attempting to fly in a counterclockwise direction but its a lot harder than i anticipated it but i feel like im getting the hang of it slowly,0,45,2,2,15
three i see the dollar sign i see the y thats a good mine four velocity four vulnerability points,0,41,1,1,382
so oh it left,0,57,4,4,975
control,0,29,8,8,557
i like how they define the bounds how when you hit it out bounce right off,0,214,4,4,336
slow down,0,12,2,2,410
alright,0,28,7,7,284
try to slow down,0,46,9,9,569
turn turn turn back the other way,0,127,1,1,200
getting it under control is the hardest thing,0,211,2,2,32
okay gained some control there we go,0,818,6,6,129
unfortunately it went out of control again,0,848,2,2,249
it goes half forward half left,0,57,3,3,918
turn,0,56,2,2,26
ok thats off to a bad start already slow it down,0,468,7,7,146
so forward,0,57,2,2,804
its a foe no too slow,0,34,1,1,43
mumbles alright im just trying to control whats going on im just all over,0,190,10,10,227
ah ok no but i get slower so i can usually avoid enemy mines,0,404,4,4,170
alright,0,29,2,2,365
this is harder to control,0,38,1,1,161
right oh lord,0,24,1,1,17
i cant hit the fortress but i have one shot left come on,0,685,7,7,149
but i also that i controlling this properly,0,54,5,5,394
i mean im always in hyperspace anyway,0,53,8,8,367
shooting at it too fast,0,14,10,10,841
control the ship,0,454,6,6,209
okay gonna go a lot slower,0,24,2,2,52
alright 6 7 alright,0,647,10,10,248
p thats a lot harder than i thought it would be i didnt think it would be that sensitive to the touch and everything and your first instinct is to back thrust and you cant do that though to slow down or anything so,0,685,1,1,22
slow down,0,51,4,4,96
umm especially with the mine coming at you faster and youre trying to avoid the bullets from the fortress as well,0,685,6,6,135
okay alright,0,454,1,1,127
its must easier to just circle it,0,12,10,10,677
alright,0,454,6,6,215
so slowly moving to okay nothing now,0,14,1,1,482
aright,0,16,8,8,650
alright im just gonna circle around the horizon,0,16,9,9,723
points are at 800 somethings but control and velocity are in the high positives,0,848,9,9,386
p alright,0,51,8,8,297
no were off into hyperspace,0,818,4,4,81
go you got move,0,51,10,10,462
why cant i circle this shit,0,16,3,3,215
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,7,7,584
i dont like going into hyperspace but sometimes hyperspace is the only way you can get away,0,804,8,8,372
then the next one comes moves way too easily,0,34,6,6,292
okay so right now the enemy mine is chasing i cant even turn around to shoot cause its so hard,0,130,3,3,275
turn man come on,0,127,4,4,236
alright this is a lot harder than i thought it would be,0,28,1,1,45
turn turn turn,0,127,4,4,235
so i guess my strategy is to just go around it and shoot at the fortress and make it go as slow as i can,0,211,2,2,31
no no no turn,0,818,9,9,232
im going too fast im out of control but we can fix that,0,319,9,9,215
i shot too fast to reset the vulnerability counter,0,12,4,4,477
alright,0,16,8,8,651
alright,0,400,1,1,105
negative 813 ship was damaged 13 times i was damaged twice by the mines and i screen warped 28 times,0,825,3,3,124
p oh alright,0,404,1,1,18
alright this is a good strategy for me here i might not get a lot of points but i might actually,0,404,7,7,266
damn alright friend,0,473,8,8,319
that was off real off oops back to the optimal method of losing control of my ship,0,818,5,5,83
got the bonus right just gotta shoot it,0,404,4,4,152
did not react fast enough,0,12,6,6,545
alright,0,16,1,1,40
alright,0,28,2,2,88
i need to slow down,0,53,8,8,388
going off screen you need to control your speed,0,51,6,6,178
p stop bumping into the fortress,0,50,8,8,87
alright oh n is enemy they move very fast by the time i look down and register hes almost on top of me,0,404,6,6,219
using the joystick with my left hand,0,53,4,4,162
avoid getting shot trying to go a little slower,0,24,1,1,19
umm if i dont move fast enough then the fortress will shoot me,0,404,1,1,41
alright i think i clicked it too rapidly and now this thing is coming to kill me,0,558,5,5,34
you didnt wanna pull back and slow down,0,647,3,3,174
i ran into that one like i completely lost control,0,825,6,6,185
i was like i knew controlling the ship was going to be pretty difficult but i didnt realize that everything was going to be so fast paced,0,404,4,4,126
alright,0,20,6,6,601
so youre kinda just not playing with any direction literally and figuratively because controlling it is hard as hell,0,977,9,9,112
just a little push and it goes really fast,0,54,2,2,326
go right go straight,0,20,6,6,603
just starting flying away,0,113,7,7,467
there okay now i can move,0,16,2,2,135
all right here we go,0,55,2,2,599
its very instinctual to press the key as fast as you can and thats not what youre supposed to do,0,12,4,4,498
alright this is the last game i gotta do a lot better than ive been doing,0,685,10,10,213
all right,0,55,4,4,732
p i dont see how anybody can fly this thing clockwise around this thing,0,127,6,6,251
slow down slow down,0,53,5,5,208
i kinda feel like in an intense situation like that you have to act quicker but if its gonna get out of control,0,647,10,10,247
p oh friend or foe mouse right counterclockwise got it,0,53,2,2,39
i was right,0,57,8,8,1315
two personal space,0,53,6,6,266
slow down,0,53,7,7,339
flying all over the place,0,190,1,1,143
control was significantly worse,0,3,4,4,75
slowly,0,300,1,1,236
alright come on,0,127,6,6,256
there and zs out 6 7 8 9 losing control losing control 10 oh,0,825,6,6,189
keep control of the ship,0,454,2,2,157
this isnt space physics surprisingly im not that low on points,0,41,2,2,400
nah thats just cuz im clicking too fast,0,30,9,9,509
going in a circle is another thing,0,468,6,6,115
alright im going to try this again,0,20,9,9,734
it moves differently sometimes,0,211,2,2,21
p its kind of hard to control the iff its friendly so,0,50,1,1,7
p the right hand on the mouse,0,57,4,4,985
so now im consistently shooting the fortress being able to kill it getting used to the ships control more getting used to flying around in a frictionless environment and compensating on the turns,0,681,1,1,218
oop the screen went black,0,411,1,1,14
mumbling turn around turn around go go go straight there,0,210,5,5,64
slow it down,0,454,7,7,223
not moving at all ok,0,569,1,1,151
still not able to control the speed quite too well for the turning,0,848,2,2,258
alright its a mine,0,24,1,1,23
alright,0,28,9,9,371
the control is a little loose,0,210,1,1,4
alright so,0,568,1,1,8
stop on screen,0,51,8,8,316
okay so this is definitely the best flight pattern,0,12,8,8,613
p mouse left,0,51,5,5,126
once it starts going fast its really hard to,0,404,10,10,380
now if i kind of go around the edge of the screen its a lot easier and a lot more time umm im still worried about points,0,404,5,5,186
turn and i died,0,28,6,6,278
alright straight right,0,20,7,7,680
if i could slow down enough to stqay in the thing,0,569,5,5,192
forward,0,51,8,8,339
ill just fly around until theres another bonus,0,3,7,7,144
alright 25 shots,0,685,10,10,224
all right so thatll take like forever to get used to i guess,0,12,1,1,345
i need to slow down bad,0,52,5,5,667
uzn right click in the interval,0,52,7,7,724
okay go forward do that,0,818,2,2,29
p just space button,0,404,1,1,46
p yeah do i press space bar,0,568,1,1,29
yea thats right,0,53,7,7,295
im flying in circles a bunch,0,468,6,6,120
alright here we go,0,28,8,8,365
p um alright,0,3,1,1,3
go forward,0,55,1,1,547
now turn this way,0,51,9,9,346
still dint move fast enough,0,12,3,3,445
alright that one mumbles,0,190,9,9,220
going slowly across,0,300,4,4,305
im just going in and out of warp zone right now,0,404,3,3,91
fly up,0,30,10,10,528
come on go forward a little bit,0,14,4,4,619
rotating slowly,0,300,4,4,312
mumbles okay stop killing me,0,113,6,6,433
alright ill try to at least destroy the fortress at least once if i hit it,0,804,4,4,272
p alright i hit it,0,404,5,5,185
i keep going in circles,0,468,6,6,132
so turn,0,57,1,1,733
it looks like a fly,0,57,6,6,1168
finally stopped getting hit immediately,0,24,2,2,68
p gotta slow down gotta slow down thats foe,0,50,8,8,96
turn and oh dead,0,28,3,3,143
alright,0,28,2,2,102
trying to regain control,0,319,5,5,121
alright thats one dollar sign thats one dollar sign,0,16,3,3,199
alright this is pretty crazy,0,190,2,2,153
try to do a fly by,0,818,6,6,146
okay slow down and aim and fire,0,28,4,4,178
dr right click,0,52,5,5,665
what left,0,51,10,10,398
i wanna get a positive one in this i cant really see theres the second one fik dodging the mines is hard i cant go counterclockwise e thats fine 7 vulnerability 8,0,130,9,9,385
p alright,0,804,10,10,397
and the other is where youre moving and its so hard to do it with just one hand,0,214,1,1,252
face forward,0,57,1,1,734
oh had to turn around,0,647,4,4,188
get back in control,0,319,10,10,257
alright im only going to shoot why i know thats a friend so bang bang,0,20,10,10,803
oh i flew right into you i tried,0,113,5,5,419
hit space to pause the game,0,57,7,7,1255
okay perfect its missing me so im doing good right now,0,34,10,10,478
nope nope slow down no slow the f come on man,0,16,10,10,808
alright thats a foe,0,473,7,7,299
i keep going into hyperspace though,0,34,2,2,73
now i gotta remember to look down at the bottom of the screen,0,568,2,2,39
okay alright were gonna go the optimal path now,0,818,3,3,43
crush him right,0,300,2,2,264
p supposed to stay inside this hexagon,0,50,3,3,28
trying to get out of the way of the shooting there was just 2 dollar signs i was able to pick up the bonus but was right after shot by the whats it called fortress,0,848,3,3,286
p alright i got one more shot,0,16,10,10,754
turn turn,0,57,1,1,770
please slow down,0,825,4,4,144
i just want you to slow down,0,300,3,3,290
too fast slow down again,0,300,1,1,247
i only got 8 shots left,0,49,6,6,387
in the hexagon in the hexagon,0,28,1,1,41
p but i feel like im starting to get the hang of it a little bit except that the joystick is very sensitive so i keep flying all over the place,0,45,1,1,7
p alright zmr are the foe mines,0,372,6,6,72
mub right click oh,0,52,1,1,461
forward,0,57,2,2,808
come on get that control up there we go,0,454,3,3,168
umm its still i think the hardest thing is identifying the bonuses cuz you have so much on the screen,0,685,7,7,159
turn and thrust and then turn and then thrust,0,53,10,10,472
umm i still have to get used to how sensitive the controller er the joystick is,0,468,2,2,26
lets gentle movements and see if that can actually help me,0,52,1,1,462
stop,0,57,1,1,738
alright that is a c so that is a friendly,0,910,2,2,42
p its hard to move,0,211,2,2,19
slow the fword okay,0,16,8,8,617
too fast in every direction,0,14,2,2,510
im flying counter clockwise im trying to,0,372,1,1,9
i just wish i could use my right hand,0,53,2,2,60
straight right straight right and left left straight oh ok straight make a right go back go straight alright come on,0,20,7,7,661
slowly rotate,0,300,1,1,254
p  alright,0,319,4,4,92
yeah x i dont know what you are so im just  going to fly away yay,0,113,7,7,464
you can only apply thrust when going forward if this game was a game i was playing in the past i would assume when going left then go right youd go right but you want you have to go right then straight which is like odd,0,977,2,2,84
i dont know if i shot him or it hit me  something happened ah stop,0,113,3,3,380
p slow down,0,50,4,4,46
alright,0,739,10,10,106
its like moving it,0,57,4,4,990
alright,0,190,2,2,154
actually staying in the control zone more than i thought it would,0,404,8,8,322
nice double tap slow down,0,910,8,8,191
oops see now im completely out of control,0,319,2,2,31
alright destroyed,0,33,1,1,421
alright this is way more,0,825,1,1,4
p like if youre flying close or risking to take a good shot or a bad shot knowing you can take the hit,0,977,9,9,111
i just realized that i have 15 shots alright then,0,558,8,8,62
l alright you my dog,0,16,8,8,641
dont know if thats right,0,3,10,10,219
p no no i wish i did i just gotta get a hold of the controls for the most part i was actually like spinning around inside the hexagon a little bit but it was just that those mines really like got me scared a little bit and i just like lost control and like ok how do i get this back,0,568,2,2,58
please stop do,0,57,9,9,1371
slow down a little,0,685,8,8,172
need to slow down,0,28,8,8,343
alright imma just work like this,0,16,3,3,233
right heres another thing that im supposed to get but i think that was the first one but im honestly not paying attention to that,0,47,1,1,7
alright there we go,0,214,2,2,274
i think im keeping that thats an enemy oh the interval is too fast my interval keeps im probably thinking too much,0,130,3,3,272
p alright omv omv omv omv omv,0,910,2,2,27
do i just press spacebar to continue,0,30,1,1,53
but now i am going way too fast again,0,848,2,2,244
p alright,0,568,2,2,35
going a little too fast but ill go with it,0,46,8,8,528
alright get out that shit,0,16,10,10,820
and turn,0,57,2,2,838
ummmmm i just dont wanna go as fast,0,57,1,1,727
im going too slow,0,16,2,2,126
p yeah like between right there and where you spawn,0,211,4,4,50
alright still getting killed by the enemy mines all the time they come on the screen pretty fast so i have to look immediately down,0,681,2,2,231
like the immediate access you have the illusion you have of moving the joystick there was like a split second of thought that went before,0,977,1,1,80
alright i think this is try number 6 or 7,0,49,7,7,439
yeah this is not very much because im having to use my left hand this is not very much of a competition i dont think,0,127,2,2,205
oh there was a mine on the screen,0,432,5,5,176
alright lets do this,0,319,8,8,192
turn turn turn,0,127,10,10,285
p oh man i was only 4000 points alright,0,558,1,1,7
alright come on,0,51,4,4,112
turn around,0,57,7,7,1205
and then i really wish you could slow down any other way,0,12,2,2,405
im not even worrying about the mines right now because im still trying to get the hang of the controls so im just focusing on killing fortress so once i get that down i can start to work on the mines,0,681,1,1,212
circles,0,26,7,7,117
bonus left,0,27,6,6,111
no that was too fast,0,33,5,5,612
to the left too much,0,300,3,3,287
it seems that if i just flick it the smallest amount it goes the velocity the game requires and that the fortress is unable to hit me and i am still able to turn and make shots okay,0,848,2,2,243
yup turn then move,0,16,6,6,446
i mean being able to control this thing is just,0,127,6,6,252
p uninterpretable 410 alright so i press continue,0,16,1,1,87
n is friendly alright the fortress is at 8 9 10 and its destroyed,0,848,10,10,400
since whenever you move in ac ertain direction you keep moving in that direction,0,12,5,5,522
turn shoot turn shoot turn shoot turn shoot turn,0,113,3,3,374
if i turn the opposite way,0,57,1,1,740
3644 smaller and smaller but yea i have a new appreciation for keyboard controls,0,155,6,6,262
not many people unintelligible feel like my biggest issue is controlling the ship since the ship doesnt stop at all,0,804,5,5,291
mub ok i need to turn that into,0,52,1,1,449
im also getting better at unconsciously flying around and shooting this thing in the middle,0,681,4,4,259
thats a good speed thats to fast thats to fast,0,52,2,2,498
second money sign 1 2 3 4 5 6 s thats a good mine 7 8 im in my no no no no no i was doing so well stop,0,41,2,2,396
its at one time right now oh it ok,0,20,2,2,460
slow down,0,28,1,1,25
then again youre in space,0,647,3,3,175
oh no is it too fast,0,34,5,5,229
i think im out of control here,0,468,7,7,158
alright bonus points left missiles,0,16,1,1,4
okay well velocity isnt doing too bad just the points right now which is,0,34,7,7,351
rotate again,0,300,2,2,265
go forward,0,20,8,8,723
i didnt mean to shoot when i moved,0,14,2,2,519
b alright you my friend,0,16,2,2,144
move,0,28,6,6,279
i keep forgetting when i need to go backward it doesnt do that,0,54,1,1,316
i gotta stop missing,0,24,5,5,119
need to slow down,0,52,3,3,539
p alright there we go,0,155,8,8,275
i cant fly this thing,0,127,3,3,225
forward,0,57,7,7,1235
i am trying to navigate but nothing is working and im just flying around without oh there we go,0,20,1,1,396
i cant even stay in the circle,0,20,1,1,391
so dont go too fast stay in the lines theres a dollar sign it disappeared,0,468,6,6,104
alright,0,558,4,4,28
okay there we go alright lets go,0,685,5,5,111
no why dont you turn,0,210,7,7,94
alright i am at 11 and i dont think i know exactly what to do there we go,0,558,10,10,71
alright and were just gonna keep following the train,0,818,6,6,137
it doesnt really go forward,0,57,3,3,917
i keep going into hyperspace so that not good losing points,0,34,1,1,39
turn turn turn,0,127,5,5,249
going slower but thats like the first hit,0,46,8,8,537
forward,0,57,2,2,806
p kyx no stop stop flying,0,210,4,4,39
moving too fast,0,14,6,6,699
alright,0,454,7,7,224
the control on this,0,454,1,1,125
turn,0,57,7,7,1207
got the mine alright just keep this speed nope nope nope ill get the hang of this in a couple of more games,0,818,4,4,67
okay wow were at 7 right now,0,34,5,5,252
ok so im definitely not in control right now,0,468,3,3,37
alright thats maybe slightly worse mumble,0,468,3,3,43
okay alright that was rude,0,113,1,1,322
p so i have a little better understanding of what is going on because i actually just realized that i am supposed to like the ship turns and i boost it its not actually moving in the direction if that makes any sense at all,0,558,2,2,9
alright come on come here,0,16,8,8,645
okay alright got some points,0,30,2,2,105
p its more harder if you try to stay inside the hexagon,0,658,5,5,39
alright q,0,16,4,4,300
my control has been good,0,825,10,10,299
in hyperspace,0,24,1,1,29
alright thats a friend,0,473,7,7,297
so its probably better to just move around,0,54,6,6,405
okay stay within the lines mumble hyperspace,0,804,10,10,419
okay alright im just going to keep doing this its going to work,0,113,10,10,528
alright,0,319,5,5,112
im stillwow mumbles a lot here i cant keep flying around like this,0,214,6,6,368
alright so instructions,0,16,4,4,265
keep going into hyperspace,0,804,5,5,287
move toward it,0,300,9,9,405
i lost control,0,818,5,5,117
out of control,0,319,5,5,131
quails stop x rays,0,53,10,10,465
p aright,0,54,1,1,298
and we are spinning out of control,0,848,7,7,337
no hyperspace,0,818,6,6,145
forward,0,300,1,1,246
inaudible okay one life left per game,0,27,2,2,31
this is just alright this is just how imma do it,0,16,3,3,239
going too fast but i missed the first missile and i slowed it down,0,46,9,9,558
now i am spinning out of control but the mine is friendly unfortunately i just ran into it and did not get any points,0,848,3,3,273
1 alright mumbles alright 3 on the vulnerability counter,0,372,7,7,86
im just gonna move like this nope that aint gonna work,0,16,9,9,728
going too fast again,0,46,8,8,535
move forward,0,57,1,1,752
alright come on,0,16,9,9,716
so now we need like more bullets cause im missing a lot of these bullets moving around too much a d so an enemy mine however i cant really shoot it bonus should use it for missiles,0,130,6,6,329
like i have to be between the hexagons to actually shoot it,0,57,8,8,1340
try to do a fly by,0,818,6,6,147
yeah moving slower on this is much easier,0,400,2,2,114
im still completely out of control,0,468,4,4,61
nope thats not slow,0,33,4,4,585
slowly slowly,0,14,1,1,454
slowly,0,28,4,4,174
ship doesnt slow down at all,0,804,1,1,240
alright,0,214,7,7,375
now its really the mines cause i realized the fortress doesnt really shoot like i can easily dodge like move away from its shots umm so like the mines are doing things to me now,0,411,7,7,106
come on move forward move forward,0,55,10,10,1016
i can like just mmm mumbles alright stop moving,0,568,2,2,49
i always hate this  all right that didnt work,0,804,5,5,283
p that is a friendly mine obviously out of control ok,0,404,5,5,190
did not wanna do that now im just flying straight at the fort,0,14,3,3,553
whatever im gonna okay i dont care if i go out of bounds,0,16,1,1,58
technically i risk being stuck in a bad movement,0,400,10,10,141
come on turn and shoot turn and shoot turn and shoot,0,16,8,8,643
thats y thatll be stuff staying inside the hexagon finally,0,130,7,7,355
okay alright oh i didnt see you,0,113,5,5,423
oh i tried to slow down by pressing the stick backwards,0,411,6,6,91
alright,0,16,3,3,212
forward,0,57,2,2,792
4 clockwise,0,52,1,1,427
it only goes forward right and left,0,54,1,1,312
there alright thats one,0,16,4,4,309
p alright closer to zero,0,16,3,3,255
p so the controls here basically,0,38,1,1,148
control the ship,0,454,5,5,190
right click in the interval,0,52,7,7,740
let me try to slow down,0,3,7,7,135
it takes a lot of control like i know if my brother were to try this he would be very like frantic and that wouldnt be like that would be difficult like hes,0,825,5,5,161
second one nice 40 shots left,0,130,2,2,257
i need to slow down,0,53,4,4,192
very small movements nothing crazy you dont need to do much,0,41,9,9,592
im actually at negative points right now,0,568,1,1,19
but if i move too fast ill lose control,0,404,1,1,42
alright,0,53,7,7,303
the tiniest movement wow wow wow,0,214,1,1,259
alright come on i got the turn game now,0,16,5,5,381
fly up fly up fly up fly up,0,30,10,10,522
shes seen me play basketball with my left hand,0,127,1,1,192
yeah definitely going too fast,0,468,3,3,41
the interval is 2 right now ah theres a mine its a friendly mine so its ok,0,404,3,3,89
going a little too fast i gotta compensate,0,681,2,2,228
thats the other space fortress,0,130,2,2,253
turn around turn around shoot it shoot,0,113,2,2,342
cant control this thing alright im moving in the right direction oh wow okay good,0,214,4,4,323
my left hand cant respond to nothin,0,16,4,4,293
alright two hand is not working so back to one,0,20,7,7,644
all right,0,57,2,2,844
so were at 6 right now 7 8 9 10 11 12 okay that was one dollar sign,0,14,7,7,725
stay on the screen,0,569,8,8,225
and for this game i will try to go as slow as possible which right out of the bat already is not happening,0,848,3,3,268
alright,0,825,7,7,213
come on turn around turn,0,127,5,5,246
alright umm no no no okay just gotta ive still yet to get any bonus points or anything,0,685,1,1,19
p oh ok sorry i was like super into this right now,0,190,8,8,212
turn turn,0,210,4,4,46
thats not the alright,0,28,1,1,50
oh get back on the screen,0,739,5,5,53
thats the hardest part honestly im just trying to control the thing umm and not go into warp speed gonna try to shoot a little bit,0,404,2,2,61
stop,0,411,6,6,93
oh this is even faster this is not good okay i think im worried,0,130,1,1,227
p im gonna stay in this hexagon,0,50,9,9,112
getting out of control,0,319,4,4,100
alright,0,404,2,2,72
going slowly,0,46,7,7,483
didnt get hit right away,0,804,7,7,313
yeah go forward,0,28,3,3,140
going into hyperspace,0,468,9,9,198
just trying to get a slow kinda like slide past the tower,0,24,4,4,96
oh alright so the hardest thing is not making any huge movements,0,319,2,2,19
thats a bracket lost all controls,0,14,5,5,636
slow down,0,51,10,10,402
slow down,0,51,7,7,256
i feel like going slow works the best,0,739,3,3,35
forward,0,57,3,3,914
turn,0,56,1,1,12
one personal space,0,53,6,6,256
im trying to turn,0,33,4,4,571
p cant go too fast,0,432,4,4,163
alright just coast,0,818,4,4,72
once you go a little too fast its almost impossible,0,12,10,10,678
alright,0,26,4,4,46
slow down or just fly off randomly i guess,0,14,4,4,616
i almost died but i got it and i only have 136 points right now so im doing a lot better than ive been doing,0,685,7,7,157
alright i got 1500 points more this time really excited,0,558,2,2,13
slow down,0,51,10,10,455
i do not want to be going that fast,0,818,2,2,30
p alright are people usually this bad,0,20,2,2,419
alright this does nothin,0,16,5,5,348
its slow down,0,12,7,7,587
stop hitting me stop coming,0,113,3,3,381
i think my control is going in vain,0,57,7,7,1216
whatcha alright come here,0,16,10,10,770
im at 4 right now as far as the vulnerability 6 7 we are now at 0 shots so a bonus would be beneficial,0,848,7,7,349
alright beef,0,16,7,7,509
ok ok slow down,0,569,6,6,205
alright imma get it back,0,16,10,10,811
i thought that was right,0,16,3,3,209
alright i gotta keep shooting im at vulnerability 3 thought i was higher damn,0,404,10,10,387
and okay yeah there we go there we go slowing down now,0,41,6,6,502
i definitely like joystick in the right hand better,0,46,2,2,332
turn around,0,57,2,2,855
turn,0,788,4,4,170
i bet i know how to move,0,16,1,1,48
trying to move it slowly control it like the keyboard,0,432,4,4,164
just go to the right,0,818,9,9,218
their processing speed is just so fast and their fire rate is insane,0,211,8,8,111
alright slow down,0,16,4,4,305
stop shooting me,0,818,10,10,256
ohh vulnerability is gone too fast,0,211,7,7,93
speed is alright this time,0,46,7,7,479
alright get out the way,0,16,4,4,325
it seems i do a little better going counterclockwise round instead of clockwise,0,558,4,4,20
im missing a lot of point right now,0,34,1,1,41
and i cant even turn,0,16,4,4,294
too bad i keep losing points because i keep going into hyperspace,0,804,7,7,340
come on its way too fast,0,46,6,6,451
no turn,0,33,9,9,832
forward,0,53,10,10,462
go forward,0,51,5,5,169
slowly move,0,14,8,8,790
wow okay thats i think i have one more hit left,0,34,6,6,285
alright try to keep going in a counterclockwise shape,0,28,3,3,125
okay alright,0,113,9,9,507
and ive just lost control,0,818,4,4,76
there are other important things like fast enough where you can dodge the fortress but slow enough to where you can shoot the fortress that middle ground was i back to zero on that one,0,432,6,6,184
i thats a friendly alright im at 10,0,404,9,9,342
i should just be a hyperspace pilot,0,53,3,3,124
alright trying to get into a good path,0,319,3,3,50
alright,0,818,5,5,106
just gonna do fly bys okay were gonna try to gain control and were gonna,0,818,4,4,78
ill just take that hit i guess and control for it,0,12,9,9,657
no alright alright ok nope nope turn,0,210,3,3,32
okay going too fast,0,12,4,4,495
um its not worth going in a circle,0,3,3,3,50
slow down,0,51,7,7,235
out of control still,0,319,10,10,258
slow,0,210,8,8,135
p okay so this time im gonna go even slower,0,214,4,4,319
umm t nope that was too fast,0,404,7,7,251
aww now its real fast oh crap,0,211,7,7,92
i feel like going in circles increases points,0,647,7,7,226
p is it just the keyboard and the controller that i need to do,0,40,4,4,97
now im flying too fast,0,3,8,8,165
yeah i dont have any control,0,57,6,6,1191
okay back in control,0,818,5,5,118
p im doing better at staying in the hexagon well i was doing better at staying in the hexagon,0,45,7,7,76
hopefully itll offset some of the 1000 because im flying in circles,0,468,4,4,59
its just way much more ummmmm lack of control,0,57,8,8,1346
like i said before until you really master the controls of this thing its like you really cant do anything else with the game thats what it seems to me,0,127,8,8,271
i am spinning out of control,0,848,10,10,403
1 2 3 got the bonus 4 5 6 6 7 8 9 10 alright now im at 440,0,372,8,8,101
oh that was a fast one,0,20,7,7,683
its best to use light taps to move the ship around rather than long drawnout ones or else itll get crazy and start flying everywhere,0,681,2,2,238
were not going fast enough,0,46,1,1,297
all of the mines they move so fast you have t get that double click first try or itll hit you,0,400,2,2,115
slow down,0,12,9,9,663
slow down,0,739,9,9,89
youre right,0,57,1,1,732
going too fast,0,319,9,9,223
turn stay,0,20,1,1,409
alright umm the vulnerability is still at 0 so i cannot attack the fortress,0,372,1,1,15
and i okay okay ive lost control a little bit,0,685,2,2,30
like right now i cant play and think,0,214,4,4,329
alright,0,54,2,2,324
alright,0,319,2,2,18
screen wrap really takes the points out of my system so if i could just avoid screen wrap then i shouldnt be mumbles,0,404,10,10,374
rotate slowly,0,300,2,2,262
ok so i think im definitely getting the controls a bit more each time its no longer like a umm oh maybe i can start playing the game,0,468,5,5,83
p alright lets get it,0,16,1,1,6
alright things are a little faster than i may have thought they would,0,28,1,1,22
it turned me completely around no i didnt want to go that way,0,818,8,8,198
turn oh wait no nevermind mumbles,0,113,3,3,373
how fast im posta,0,16,6,6,457
i wasnt expecting to be using my left hand um cause im a righthanded person,0,53,1,1,11
stop stop stop stop,0,41,3,3,418
turn,0,210,10,10,168
oh that was too fast,0,28,9,9,378
alright what this is,0,16,5,5,376
mumbles out go back in mumbles move or stay inside okay,0,26,8,8,125
perfect it worked alright so now we are going to continue that by trying to fly at a slow enough velocity to gain points by also staying within the edges of the box so control does not take too much of a hit,0,848,5,5,311
its really hard to stay on course when you have an objective like once i go past 13 im doing circles,0,647,7,7,225
p opposite direction so youre like trying to continuously turn i guess,0,468,2,2,23
come in slow,0,300,7,7,366
mumbles just fly by like this,0,57,10,10,1495
i gotta stop going into space,0,214,9,9,399
ive also just kind of completelt disregardedsp control and velocity at this point and focused on getting mine hits,0,12,3,3,431
it flies too fast,0,20,6,6,607
trying to control my speed,0,319,4,4,88
okay well im kind getting how the movement works,0,34,9,9,417
alright,0,28,1,1,34
im going so fast,0,28,6,6,257
alright oh gotta keep moving,0,28,5,5,223
laughs it takes really slight movements,0,190,1,1,138
was that not fast enough,0,16,9,9,742
it is quite difficult to control,0,848,1,1,239
alright i got a friendly mine n thats,0,404,6,6,226
im controlling it,0,818,10,10,272
these three minutes really go by fast when youre trash,0,41,6,6,515
can i stop,0,127,8,8,275
to the left,0,56,1,1,11
so going counterclockwise around this thing is not even an option for me or clockwise should i say,0,127,2,2,209
yes alright,0,51,5,5,171
alright its getting a little easier now after 7 games im able to oh shoot okay,0,685,7,7,144
alright theres one,0,54,8,8,424
okay im starting to get in a rhythm of moving around and shooting this thing,0,681,4,4,254
i dont know if its cuz i played 10 rounds with the keyboard or the keyboard is less sensitive but i feel like the keyboard gives you more control over the space ship,0,977,2,2,85
so yeah just trying to understand the movement and get the muscle memory down because it might take some time,0,468,3,3,42
if i could just do this slow enough,0,432,6,6,187
alright i dont know who designed this game but its so hard,0,51,3,3,60
74 shots left,0,372,2,2,27
no overturned it,0,28,5,5,227
9 i got 1 more then i gotta start going for the control shot,0,404,7,7,263
im going to preserve my bullets and try to at least alright i got more bullets so im good for a little bit,0,685,4,4,90
ebf right click,0,52,9,9,841
yeah this hexagonal thing is not,0,52,7,7,716
i gotta remember to move immediately,0,404,5,5,200
the red bomb doesnt have to hit you really even if its close it counts like a hit even when i go slowly,0,432,4,4,165
slow down,0,51,7,7,257
alright,0,28,10,10,439
dang i just dont be moving way quick enough,0,16,4,4,290
hyperspace game,0,53,6,6,290
stop on the screen and stop it,0,51,8,8,323
yeah i think i forfeited staying in that um hexagon so now its just a game all about timing and accuracy to hopefully destroy one of these,0,825,4,4,137
its like try to lean forward slowly,0,57,6,6,1123
alright,0,16,1,1,34
im definitely not earning points for the control,0,468,6,6,127
still getting used still trying to stay in the control area for the most part,0,404,1,1,30
make a left,0,20,7,7,651
out of control out of control out of control,0,319,9,9,236
alright lets get it,0,16,3,3,245
at this point i just have to slowly drift off and not get shot at,0,411,8,8,126
im actually going to stay in this hexagon,0,52,3,3,561
quick to fly off the edge,0,14,3,3,567
now im just going in circles,0,57,6,6,1167
alright i which is an enemy mine,0,404,3,3,111
rotate,0,57,5,5,1107
p alright the foe mines are r y and g,0,848,7,7,335
alright,0,28,1,1,64
slow down,0,12,3,3,446
i keep running into stuff alright,0,454,1,1,126
it spins very fast,0,848,1,1,223
i can turn around,0,52,6,6,674
slowly cross,0,300,3,3,285
need to get it to slow down,0,52,3,3,540
oh its faster now i can aim better though this way,0,211,6,6,86
okay im just going to try and go faster,0,34,3,3,135
p i really need to learn to play left handed,0,658,8,8,61
p thrust,0,29,3,3,389
im flying off in a random direction,0,14,1,1,480
alright get outta here,0,16,2,2,154
its off the screen,0,3,4,4,72
left counterclockwise right clockwise,0,52,2,2,474
wanna wait out these mines in hyperspace,0,41,2,2,398
slow down,0,51,4,4,114
speeds more than i would like or velocity,0,46,5,5,407
apparently shooting it does not work so im gonna have to stop doing that,0,804,10,10,411
turn,0,210,6,6,73
its hard to go forward,0,57,5,5,1062
try to go real slow,0,739,5,5,54
and then the fact that backwards on the control pad doesnt do anything,0,404,2,2,64
lets stop lets stop,0,34,8,8,380
the mines i completely forgot about them ive been trying to just get the controls down,0,658,2,2,25
dont move,0,12,4,4,497
going too slow to get away from the mines,0,46,5,5,428
im going too slow,0,12,6,6,556
oh right there,0,454,4,4,180
forward,0,57,7,7,1226
right now im trying to turn around the fortress as best to my ability and learning the controls a little better,0,848,1,1,235
so im supposed to point at them and hit the right mouse button,0,658,2,2,27
slow down,0,51,7,7,233
okay so lets slow down slow down,0,34,9,9,423
turn,0,127,4,4,237
why did you move,0,155,4,4,237
move up over around,0,14,10,10,858
you lose control and its very hard to find it,0,217,2,2,64
alright,0,24,3,3,85
p turn ok,0,210,4,4,48
moving too fast,0,3,7,7,123
p its just really hard to control right now,0,27,1,1,6
no no just flying around,0,818,9,9,228
slow down,0,51,6,6,211
personal space,0,53,6,6,255
left click it gave me the bonus,0,300,5,5,328
okay keep going going to the right and not get hit,0,818,8,8,196
p spacebar,0,55,2,2,553
stay in the hexagon,0,300,2,2,270
alright,0,319,2,2,22
okay alright,0,825,2,2,56
40 shots left,0,54,1,1,304
alright umm see a mine i hit it head on it disappeared so im guessing it didnt do damage and its friendly,0,468,7,7,151
let me keep moving to escape,0,34,2,2,98
okay lets try to maneuver,0,57,9,9,1373
hyperspace my own element mumbles,0,468,7,7,150
one personal space,0,53,6,6,265
my speed is turning,0,130,3,3,282
exp alright,0,41,2,2,392
p um yeah im kinda trying to get it to go as slow as i can because it moves very fast,0,211,2,2,30
p there is no strategy going on here i will tell you that right now im just trying to get a hold of the controls here,0,568,1,1,17
move,0,57,10,10,1490
i died that time right,0,211,4,4,60
okay i dont care if i go out of bounds,0,16,2,2,103
alright now im gonna start shooting the fortress now,0,28,4,4,161
i really dont want this guy to go off the screen but he keeps wanting to do that,0,47,5,5,65
this time also i am able to travel with that clockwise position around the fortress,0,848,4,4,293
okay forward,0,57,7,7,1240
umm alright so i got lucky that it was a friendly mine,0,404,1,1,20
3 4 come on zach alright im going a little fast,0,685,8,8,171
all right so i have z,0,55,8,8,938
its very hard to get any control points or velocity points,0,12,1,1,365
im adjusting flight for the fly by tactic again moving to that side,0,910,2,2,43
all i gotta do is keep gdoing what i was doing keep to the right go slow and well get this eventually,0,818,7,7,190
alright im at vulnerability 6 try to alter my path a little bit,0,404,6,6,229
p xgi mumbles alright so im just going to keep going,0,113,7,7,453
your ship wrapped the screen 42 times,0,53,6,6,289
the biggest problem is definitely keeping this thing under control and then once you do that theres definitely better ways to capitalize on the mines but im pretty sure you can just shoot them all so i dont know,0,47,6,6,95
left,0,20,7,7,657
i must control my movement,0,468,9,9,207
im trying to go right and its not working,0,20,1,1,404
alright you have to be a pro gamer to do well in this game,0,20,7,7,666
velocity is alright,0,46,8,8,543
alright,0,26,5,5,67
or too fast,0,34,1,1,44
stop spinning fly direct,0,210,4,4,40
alright viw,0,20,3,3,493
turning,0,28,6,6,242
i suck at control,0,57,7,7,1201
got me going way too fast,0,46,4,4,397
turn turn,0,28,10,10,446
okay slow go to 10 then rapid fire,0,300,10,10,409
and go forward,0,28,7,7,289
i probably gotta turn the other way,0,16,9,9,696
1528 uninterpretable alright get him out of here,0,16,4,4,333
its very hard to control,0,404,1,1,10
its an ally mine i cant stop myself to shoot,0,130,3,3,285
turn,0,818,10,10,252
alright,0,28,8,8,362
alright got up to 7 that time,0,558,6,6,50
p ah jeez slow down slow down,0,50,5,5,52
i know there bonus points but i dont wanna get hurt if i touch the hexagon,0,57,9,9,1402
not worried about bonuses right now,0,28,3,3,132
trying to stay inside the hexagon for those extra points but its really hard to control,0,130,1,1,231
trying to move forward and rotate,0,300,1,1,238
slow down and turn and move,0,28,10,10,428
gonna complain of my horrible flying,0,14,7,7,737
okay ill just fly around i guess,0,12,2,2,397
still going too fast second dollar sign,0,319,7,7,183
alright stick and move,0,16,4,4,326
so there we slowed down,0,57,4,4,1002
im circling,0,468,8,8,182
so right about now i am thinking i kind of want to be ambidextrous,0,53,4,4,151
why do i keep moving to the center,0,33,2,2,520
stop running into the tower,0,24,7,7,166
p alright umm the hardest part to me is staying inside the hexagon umm and i guess yeah staying inside the hexagon is probably the hardest thing,0,685,2,2,27
just slow down,0,30,5,5,244
gotta get like the right speed,0,43,6,6,158
pretty in control with this o thats a friendly mine oh man i hit the wrong button,0,404,5,5,178
ah gotta keep it on the screen,0,739,5,5,51
come on mumbles lets drive backwards right into it,0,55,1,1,523
okay i can turn this way,0,16,7,7,516
slow down,0,27,6,6,113
hmm not fast enough nope,0,568,2,2,47
forward,0,57,2,2,807
p okay alright so thats a friendly mine,0,28,1,1,60
im getting better at like controlling it,0,43,8,8,185
p alright the foe mines are u i and f and this is with the joystick this time instead of the keyboard,0,848,1,1,221
swipe right,0,27,1,1,19
how are you supposed to go in a circle and shoot,0,739,7,7,73
349 i need to stop shooting i guess,0,569,9,9,245
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,4,4,295
i need to get closer instead of spinning in circles which i dont know how to do,0,52,8,8,756
controlling the spaceship is the hardest thing here,0,28,1,1,51
kinda staying inside the hexagon right now,0,130,6,6,326
im flying,0,57,10,10,1485
turning it around is oh thats a bad mine i cant really shoot,0,130,4,4,301
still holding slow steady,0,41,4,4,463
im gunna try something different im gunna try a fly by tactic,0,910,2,2,36
i got to stay inside this hexagon thing,0,54,10,10,458
oh what if i just turned like this,0,57,5,5,1045
slow down,0,51,7,7,278
i just shoot it and if it doesnt go down i just fly up,0,43,5,5,148
very hard to control,0,12,8,8,617
starting to lose control a little bit,0,432,9,9,212
umm alright,0,28,10,10,448
come on just wanna rotate,0,30,2,2,69
switches from left hand to right hand,0,685,1,1,11
learn how to move,0,16,8,8,672
its so hard im trying to figure out how to control and im trying to shoot,0,214,8,8,385
but also control the speed too,0,54,4,4,358
oh my got its getting faster,0,211,3,3,43
aright come on,0,16,7,7,572
make a right make a left go straight go straight,0,20,7,7,650
the letter is l so im not very good at controlling this,0,3,1,1,12
this is the 5th game and i still have not mastered the flight pattern,0,20,5,5,558
alright and one two oh i missed and died before it,0,825,5,5,172
im ready to fly a real plane now,0,40,3,3,94
there we go slow down,0,51,8,8,317
forward and rotate,0,300,1,1,239
alright,0,16,2,2,119
1 2 3 4 5 at this point im forgetting the letters and just focusing on staying in the circle,0,647,9,9,240
p cxb i need to get a hold of the rotation,0,569,2,2,162
uggghhh go forward,0,30,3,3,133
alright this,0,16,9,9,748
im getting too busy staying in the circle and im forgetting to shoot,0,20,7,7,664
p im getting the interval too fast and i know im doing it too fast whenever i do it its just a habit of clicking it as fast as i can instead of thinking of the time,0,685,6,6,129
control the ship,0,454,5,5,196
then turn,0,57,3,3,950
alright come on,0,16,8,8,670
no forward,0,55,3,3,675
slow down,0,53,3,3,119
turn,0,57,3,3,935
slow down,0,51,4,4,115
alright,0,647,3,3,178
alright what is it,0,16,5,5,365
alright lets get it,0,16,5,5,393
its kind of hard when im warping in and out of the screen i actually managed to hit it,0,404,5,5,183
just trying to keep it on the screen,0,739,3,3,34
is it like i think i think camera that every time i hit the hexagon the little hexagon on the side that the thing is pointing that the fortress is pointing like that i get a vulnerability point,0,49,6,6,392
i feel like everytime i lose slight control i just fly off into space,0,12,2,2,424
control man,0,49,1,1,279
alright i think i did better this time around,0,568,2,2,50
oh alright just hit the enemy mine actually pretty proud of myself when i do that i dont get that much,0,404,6,6,228
p okay alright,0,214,8,8,383
p alright this is probably gonna be worse than the keyboard then if i have to use my left hand,0,127,1,1,181
i cant do this thing lefthanded,0,127,4,4,241
keep going to the right no dont go into hyperspace,0,818,7,7,180
p i am not knowing how to control this,0,568,1,1,11
alright,0,404,8,8,288
little movements x2,0,52,3,3,538
frictionless is right,0,411,1,1,5
interval was right,0,34,1,1,37
p my score got really good really fast,0,825,6,6,201
alright alright gotta slow down someh okay,0,28,1,1,18
so right now we are spinning inside and try to not die,0,848,6,6,329
p im trying to go slow and clockwise,0,50,1,1,9
qcu right click in the interval shoot it,0,52,10,10,890
alright come on friend come on friend come on friend,0,16,2,2,132
i can turn for days,0,57,5,5,1043
its very difficult to control the thing and i wish this guy would stop trying to shoot me and lets see,0,47,1,1,5
no dont dont dont lose control,0,818,8,8,210
especially i think the hardest thing for me right now is figuring out what to like after i gain speed,0,468,2,2,20
no i dont wanna go off the e i went off the edge again,0,14,5,5,639
turn trying to get into a good path trying to get some shots down friendly mine approaching,0,319,2,2,37
ad that its difficult to stay in this hexagon thing,0,54,5,5,377
okay go for it alright turn,0,113,2,2,350
i dont know why they turn to asteroids,0,24,10,10,231
come on  turn the right way,0,55,6,6,822
stop moving so fast slow down slow down,0,16,8,8,616
okay what is this right now,0,34,3,3,132
quails stop x rays because their shells are really hard,0,53,10,10,454
and then why did i rotate way too far and dead,0,14,9,9,825
p counterclockwise,0,26,2,2,12
going too fast,0,46,1,1,301
alright,0,16,5,5,402
p hgt okay if its hg and t stop them if its not well im gunna forget this is only round two,0,825,2,2,46
for one thing it definitely is easier to stay going slower,0,57,2,2,786
alright,0,26,1,1,5
alright just just trying to stabilize,0,30,3,3,127
i cant just stop like i wasnt moving,0,52,7,7,720
im started to go too fast at that,0,12,8,8,616
slow down please,0,41,3,3,417
one dollar sign damn hyperspace,0,468,10,10,216
alright aim and fire thats 6 starting to get better at this,0,825,2,2,70
alright just gonna focus on sp velocity,0,28,3,3,130
alright so yeah 2373,0,568,2,2,52
get control of the ship,0,454,10,10,254
im out of control i see a dollar sign its the first time though second time,0,319,5,5,117
slow passes,0,300,3,3,282
alright,0,28,4,4,179
wrapped around screen 25 times,0,658,2,2,24
they say the best strategy is to stay inside the hexagon but thats really hard to do,0,685,6,6,133
alright this game is impossible,0,20,2,2,441
okay turn oh wow turn,0,113,2,2,349
it was slower,0,53,8,8,393
mumbles going too fast,0,319,3,3,58
try to stay inside of here its not working right now,0,54,3,3,353
alright the fortress already has 2 hits and the dollar sign but unfortunately a punctuation mark happened or a question mark,0,848,3,3,281
trying to figure out how to have better control,0,788,4,4,174
stop stop stop stop stop,0,53,10,10,476
alright so i think i got a pretty good strategy,0,190,8,8,209
just gonna fly around cuz i have no shots,0,43,9,9,197
i need to just slow down but i cant,0,52,1,1,447
all right keep going,0,55,7,7,862
alright cool,0,53,4,4,145
right when i get to the end it kills me,0,404,7,7,277
alright come on,0,16,4,4,307
g is a bad one i was too quick on my interval entered hyperspace,0,41,1,1,375
50 going forward,0,57,3,3,949
atleast i got the bonuses right now,0,210,3,3,28
flying backwards that is how you do it,0,113,10,10,540
uhh alright,0,825,4,4,151
alright we are hitting the fortress better this time but i just realized i am at negative shots so those will now have to be used sparingly or until i receive the next bonus,0,848,6,6,331
alright alabama,0,14,10,10,839
mumbles going too fast going way too fast,0,319,3,3,63
the whole tap thing on the left,0,300,8,8,376
seems if i get too slow i get killed by the center immediately so i have to maintain some velocity,0,681,3,3,242
p yeah alright back to 2,0,558,4,4,26
mumbles i turned it into a,0,52,4,4,583
yea your ship was damaged 13 times and screen wrapped around less than last time,0,53,3,3,133
and it lets me only move the joystick in a very like parallel movements if that makes sense,0,411,10,10,147
alright thats one back,0,16,2,2,142
well i guess if i keep shooting maybe someday ill get something right,0,49,4,4,351
stinkin move,0,16,5,5,404
trying to get back into hexagon,0,130,9,9,408
its not hitting the space station,0,804,8,8,360
ship is going very very fast,0,804,6,6,302
rotate myself and then gently,0,52,2,2,524
now we are spinning around trying to shoot or not get hit by this mine that i just turned into a deadly mine,0,848,4,4,299
22 shots left,0,26,5,5,79
alright lets do this,0,319,6,6,141
alright move,0,54,3,3,350
i can probablyalright,0,214,5,5,355
yeah i think i definitely like the keyboard control much better,0,155,1,1,180
13 shots left,0,26,9,9,159
my reaction time is a little bit slower cause i have to look at the ifs thing remember what the letters were and then shoot at it,0,411,7,7,107
slow down slow down slow down,0,28,10,10,410
mine moving forward again,0,300,9,9,394
vulnerability at 3 which is good im not at total negative points right now,0,804,7,7,333
slow down,0,51,5,5,145
going pretty slowly,0,46,7,7,490
going faster than i would like to,0,46,4,4,379
very quickly hit control im trying to uninterpretable vulnerability is trash,0,41,6,6,510
getting control of this,0,432,2,2,148
ok turn,0,210,5,5,65
alright bvd,0,28,10,10,454
turn around,0,55,7,7,878
so i need to click faster next time between the 2,0,468,6,6,124
oh i shot to fast,0,34,4,4,211
alright best score yet,0,558,7,7,57
rotate slowly,0,14,3,3,547
still going too fast,0,319,5,5,125
okay thats just keep going to the right hyperspaceit,0,818,8,8,206
you just can like go in a circle,0,51,4,4,107
i just want to be more competent with my left,0,53,4,4,157
alright back to zero,0,16,5,5,356
p well just stop after 10,0,681,5,5,265
p make the spacebar a pause button,0,56,6,6,74
i did not wanna go hyper,0,14,3,3,543
so well try one of the techniques of flying off the screen to avoid being hit by the fortress because it shot a lot last game,0,848,8,8,353
p alright it stopped,0,214,7,7,371
no i had 10 velocity,0,34,9,9,414
alright thats one,0,16,4,4,318
that was evenly faster,0,12,9,9,661
wish it didnt shoot right away when the game starts makes it a little difficult,0,34,7,7,338
trying to go slow,0,300,7,7,361
so trying to stay within the hexagon,0,468,7,7,139
alright nope nope nope nope nope nope nope,0,818,2,2,19
because im pretty sure to destroy the mines its tapping the right clicker or i forget i dont really know what exactly to call it but i am not entirely sure if its actually doing anything,0,558,6,6,44
p alright,0,20,3,3,465
umm that hyperspace word makes me want to watch that movie with owen wilson,0,53,3,3,125
still cant control the ship at all,0,569,2,2,166
and turn,0,300,10,10,411
alright i just destroyed the fortress so that strategy seems to work,0,372,5,5,64
left,0,51,10,10,431
p hyperspace,0,848,9,9,367
this is im not really skilled with my left hand,0,127,1,1,190
uzn nice right click nice,0,52,7,7,717
alright thats an e,0,16,7,7,534
ok so if i just move it like that it should work,0,52,2,2,527
4 mumbles mumbles i can control this thing i should nope,0,26,5,5,84
am i clicking too fast i must be,0,52,4,4,613
so fast oh,0,211,7,7,100
all right greater than symbol,0,55,4,4,696
trying to slow us back down and come back in the right direction towards the space,0,848,10,10,404
were gonna go the optimal path this time alright gonna turn around alright lets gothats not that fast,0,818,1,1,7
i know the recommended strategy was go counterclockwise but if my ship starts going clockwise gonna try to go with it because its so hard to control,0,404,9,9,355
move forward,0,28,2,2,79
forward,0,57,7,7,1232
i keep going out of bounds,0,454,1,1,133
ah come on i had 2 shots left to kill it and i died thats not cool,0,685,8,8,166
okay i didnt expect it to be that hard to control it,0,27,1,1,17
i cant control this its wobbling,0,432,3,3,157
y i dont remember i dont remember he number right now,0,34,7,7,346
ah going too fast cant adjust,0,411,10,10,151
p its just very small movements,0,41,9,9,590
alright this a a,0,16,3,3,230
its like impossible to shoot right,0,3,2,2,32
spin around spin around not fly off,0,14,1,1,473
i just go backwards or left to right i dont know,0,211,7,7,103
okay thats how you move,0,27,1,1,5
definitely the controls though pretty simple game overall,0,818,3,3,37
alright,0,30,2,2,106
turn shoot,0,28,3,3,123
my score is slowly going down,0,804,8,8,373
im not supposed to be flying out of there i lose points,0,20,3,3,508
alright so a mine just destroyed me but i am inside the fortress now traveling at a slow speed and just collected a bonus but then was then shot and destroyed by the fortress,0,848,4,4,292
forward,0,55,10,10,1026
come on lets move out the way alright,0,16,9,9,739
ok q ah man wrong interval too interval was too slow,0,404,4,4,155
decent velocity,0,46,10,10,599
cant slow down,0,46,7,7,506
gotta make sure i stay inside this hexagon,0,54,3,3,348
god he never stops moving,0,20,2,2,431
i think i hot too fast,0,12,1,1,359
oh and hes flying on his own again,0,20,2,2,425
so hopefully this time i can slow my velocity down,0,130,2,2,244
alright a lot more difficult already,0,788,1,1,142
its not very straight forward,0,57,2,2,796
p alright the foe mines are h k and e,0,848,3,3,267
and right before i had it again,0,818,9,9,235
ah i ran into the friendly mine because i was moving too fast,0,3,7,7,130
but i have been trying to do that by not going as fast as possible with the speed controls on the joystick were a little sensitive for mumbles the fortress was at 8 points again unfortunately he was destroyed or i was destroyed so he was unable to be destroyed,0,848,1,1,234
okay seem to be going slow and the slower i go the more velocity points i get,0,34,10,10,481
so its a little faster than that the right click,0,24,2,2,67
sometimes its like harder for me to move it,0,211,6,6,83
slow only forward when you have to,0,300,4,4,299
turn go straight,0,210,10,10,169
im gonna focus on staying in the hexagon,0,300,2,2,272
im not even moving,0,57,4,4,980
im pretty sure oh no it just popped up i didnt have time to get it im going too fast however thats too fast an interval to kill the mine at the mine,0,130,2,2,256
oh yeah alright i see how im a i see how imma duck these things,0,16,3,3,237
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1208
keeping slow this time,0,46,9,9,591
slowly i turn a little,0,57,6,6,1121
p uz and n uz and n uz and n uzn right click interval stupid interval thing i hate that,0,52,7,7,713
when youre moving too fast its probably best to just like let yourself fly off the screen cause then you can like instead of turning around it does it for you basically,0,12,4,4,482
oh jeeze oh my god slow down,0,53,1,1,31
2 hits gotta set myself back up so it moves perfectly,0,372,6,6,74
alright,0,190,1,1,142
slowly drift here,0,14,6,6,695
its moving very fast,0,211,1,1,5
trying to move inch by inch but its so hard to do,0,12,5,5,529
i need to slow down and focus on my 2 shots,0,130,7,7,343
right now i am just trying to stay within the hexagon the best i can while shooting the fortress,0,848,6,6,327
right click,0,52,4,4,592
part of me also feels like when i lean forward it really doesnt do anything,0,57,1,1,760
because i havent really began to come on turn,0,127,9,9,280
all right so try to move,0,12,1,1,350
so theres kind of no thinking going on im just trying to control the thing,0,818,1,1,10
alright,0,14,4,4,585
so the velocity is negative the control is,0,130,2,2,263
flying off this is,0,14,1,1,447
i think i had positive control points so pretty excited about that,0,558,7,7,58
alright alright alright youre not an enemy so you can hit me okay,0,113,9,9,506
stop okay there we go g i think is a bad one and im dead,0,41,1,1,372
you know its like a drunk pilot and it got ahold of the starship enterprise and it just decided to space fortress p is a bad mine i think im gonna shoot that and it turns out that it was,0,41,1,1,384
keep going around clockwise,0,647,3,3,173
going too fast,0,319,6,6,150
straight right straight right straight left left left left,0,20,7,7,660
alright,0,16,4,4,286
p alright,0,24,1,1,47
go around the hexagon,0,57,5,5,1096
alright slow down slow down,0,28,7,7,285
its going real fast,0,647,3,3,172
this is really hard to control,0,26,2,2,15
right now im just trying to fly within the,0,848,10,10,408
i think i got it under control for this one,0,49,6,6,398
but still control is at an alltime minimum,0,558,4,4,22
alright,0,16,7,7,511
i think i got a little bit of control,0,372,1,1,8
its just staying inside this hexagon is the worst part,0,685,5,5,106
when i grew up it was space invaders not something like this,0,127,2,2,214
alright come on where you at,0,16,7,7,527
ok this is the longest ive stayed in the circle so clearly im doing something right when i talk to myself aloud,0,20,7,7,662
because when i barely move vertically it starts shooting at me which makes like a con to moving slowly,0,400,3,3,120
aright,0,16,3,3,194
clockwise right,0,26,2,2,14
its just hard to get back to slow,0,57,2,2,787
alright turn and move,0,16,4,4,276
control,0,57,6,6,1190
and turn shoot,0,28,8,8,346
10 shots left,0,29,6,6,508
your ship wrapped the screen 40 times,0,51,3,3,84
i got a lot of points for staying in the circle,0,12,10,10,692
got a slow speed that works,0,46,10,10,625
im still confused how this thing is still moving its crazy ive been playing this for a while now,0,214,6,6,367
see 3 shots right now thats not good,0,300,9,9,400
alright one  sign,0,20,3,3,478
usually when its closer or go slower i do worse,0,211,6,6,87
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1215
alright,0,16,3,3,207
if i go slow enough,0,55,10,10,1037
no no stop,0,818,8,8,194
i so happen to run okay not really thinking about much right now just thinking about how to slow down,0,41,6,6,501
too fast,0,56,7,7,108
please stop do,0,57,9,9,1389
cbe right click in the interval shoot at it,0,52,8,8,779
too fast sometimes,0,432,1,1,137
its like space galactic,0,49,9,9,458
ok managing to stay in the control zone,0,404,9,9,350
turn around this way yes okay you bounced right off i thought you were going to die,0,818,2,2,32
just get into the hexagon,0,28,1,1,39
alright ydm we got a g,0,16,9,9,689
now im losing control velocity isnt doing to bad,0,34,7,7,359
going too fast going too fast,0,319,8,8,198
alright,0,16,2,2,98
so lets try the original  since the shooting is a little easier sacrifice the velocity needs to slow down a bit,0,848,5,5,308
start out slow,0,300,3,3,281
p alright round two what am i going to do,0,825,1,1,44
also the velocity is a lot harder to control,0,788,2,2,159
sometimes just rotating accelerates you mumbles and then you end up flying everywhere,0,190,10,10,228
it turns so quickly,0,739,2,2,22
i was going to slow mumbles,0,404,10,10,382
alright yes,0,473,3,3,250
slowly,0,28,4,4,173
alright,0,825,10,10,293
just coast right on by,0,818,10,10,271
hyperspace captain,0,53,4,4,174
qcu yeah right,0,52,10,10,884
ok little movements,0,52,3,3,542
control the ship,0,454,5,5,202
fly up and oh thats the ending,0,30,6,6,320
all right weve got the question mark,0,55,3,3,632
