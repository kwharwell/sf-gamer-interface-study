trying to shoot and stay clockwise,0,468,7,7,141
trying to slow down,0,46,1,1,295
p okay uhm so i cant slow down,0,50,1,1,3
control is a lot harder,0,46,1,1,308
no this is really hard to fly,0,33,9,9,821
friendly mine helps and we are spinning around within the hexagon just shooting him without any resistance at all,0,848,9,9,373
just moving up and down,0,411,9,9,133
p alright same shit,0,16,6,6,434
keep forgetting that it doesnt go diagonal at all,0,54,1,1,311
alright,0,16,2,2,137
turn turn turn turn turn,0,56,6,6,76
alright one dollar sign,0,54,3,3,346
literally flight path is impossible maybe itll be easier with joystick,0,20,4,4,534
p alright the d a and q,0,848,6,6,317
alright now i know how i gotta stick a move okay i gotta stick a move,0,16,2,2,130
one thing i noticed is it shoots you right as soon as you start so you start with negative points,0,685,5,5,96
oh man so theres no way of slowing it down,0,211,3,3,39
stupid space fortress,0,52,7,7,736
i have lost track of the money right now,0,34,2,2,88
control of the joystick is a lot harder than the keyboard,0,788,4,4,175
p alright lets try this again,0,29,5,5,463
alright lets try ti get the 10 shot,0,910,4,4,102
i have a few strategies one i tried to keep it in the same line and let it go into hyperspace and just aim to shoot but,0,432,2,2,146
ah mumbles got out of control about to get nailed by the fortress shot,0,404,6,6,233
i wrote the flight path that i wanted to do but this is not working,0,20,1,1,410
alright right now we are staying within the borders of the uh fortress in order to try and boost our control points before we  we were at 9 vulnerability points and the fortress destroyed us,0,848,8,8,354
seem to keep going into hyperspace so jd thats a friend,0,34,3,3,138
alright do i just go on to the next one,0,51,1,1,20
this thing move quick,0,16,1,1,14
alright well destroyed the fortress once time,0,404,8,8,327
alright where that shit at,0,16,5,5,362
okay lemmy move out the way,0,16,1,1,31
okay going way too fast,0,818,5,5,111
alright,0,28,4,4,170
alright turn turn turn turn,0,210,6,6,83
p ok alright,0,404,5,5,206
controls just dont matter anymore,0,14,2,2,501
ill get some bonus right now nice,0,20,2,2,461
like hey yea i got this and actually like flies circles around and actually like defeats it,0,53,4,4,171
alright lemmy learn how to move while i okay,0,16,8,8,673
i think the next time i play this game its going to switch the controls on me,0,53,1,1,32
ok so i feel like im just turning the ship and i dont know how to actually um like move it forward,0,468,1,1,7
so with the mines its better to shoot them right away then check while youre shooting to see whether or not theyre enemy or friendly and if they are enemy then take down the defenses and if theyre friendly you already shot them,0,681,6,6,285
ah knew that was gonna happen i was right that was friendly didnt have time to look at the iff there either,0,404,9,9,354
alright,0,685,2,2,31
got hit right away,0,46,7,7,489
gonna try to start controlling the ship a little bit more,0,404,4,4,137
alright my score went down again thats always promising,0,558,5,5,39
its spinning in circles the whole entire,0,52,2,2,518
the space ship,0,130,8,8,378
now im gonna start focusing on i guess that well staying in the control zone,0,404,10,10,368
turn,0,51,5,5,163
okay well i cant get the interval right now but there we go,0,34,8,8,391
forward,0,55,3,3,651
p ok so im trying to control the uh ship and im playing the joystick controls not very well,0,468,1,1,3
stop,0,51,6,6,177
so we got 2 shots right now,0,34,5,5,243
yep alright,0,30,7,7,370
p oh ok alright,0,404,7,7,274
i got to slow down,0,34,7,7,334
i expected to go faster,0,46,7,7,486
p so up thrust,0,52,2,2,473
one come on slow down slow down,0,53,7,7,297
slowly,0,56,10,10,181
alright im out one,0,16,6,6,490
dog i cannot turn for shit,0,16,9,9,700
left,0,910,1,1,17
alright thats round 4,0,825,4,4,154
its a little easier to know to stop your rotation,0,685,7,7,146
oh alright then i have to pay attention i have to pay attention to that a little bit more,0,825,4,4,139
ok trying to stay back in control,0,404,4,4,164
the closer i get to it the control zone is very hard to stay in because i get hit pretty fast,0,404,4,4,160
money sign left click bonus,0,681,8,8,304
pu and f well hyperspace is going to help me get a away,0,34,10,10,456
p ah alright,0,20,2,2,421
alright,0,28,1,1,4
alright,0,16,3,3,177
okay hit thei have terrible movement,0,468,9,9,202
oh woops the speed has to do with how fast you kill the mines i was thinking of velocity but velocity was better in that game,0,848,4,4,291
p full game mumbles rules that are written on screen,0,53,6,6,242
so i got one more hit left,0,34,6,6,313
right,0,57,4,4,1033
slow down,0,51,7,7,286
so take care of that then i guess not slowly get into position were just gonna die,0,14,6,6,687
come on alright bad,0,16,3,3,238
alright,0,16,8,8,610
okay thats 1 down probably the fastest ill ever do it 1 got the missile 2 3 4 almost 5 you are t you are nothing important,0,825,6,6,190
i pretty much have to hit it two more times right,0,404,5,5,209
rotate,0,300,1,1,250
ah i never get away fast enough so it doesnt hit me,0,113,7,7,460
so i have to turn that into a,0,52,1,1,439
gentle movements,0,52,2,2,526
i cant control myself,0,16,3,3,252
okay score is slowly going up,0,681,3,3,249
p i keep flying outside of the hexagon which is making me lose points which isnt good,0,45,2,2,12
gotta say this mumbles clockwise,0,28,6,6,253
move forward,0,57,1,1,751
alright definitely not getting the once youre staying in lines,0,468,1,1,13
alright slow down,0,16,1,1,19
alright i gotta turn than move,0,16,6,6,445
alright,0,190,3,3,162
trying to slow back down mumbles,0,848,3,3,274
okay so i have to be in control,0,57,7,7,1200
uh the vulnerability of the fortress is at 11 right now and hopefully i can get a good  i got the shot off before i was able to destroy it,0,848,2,2,256
that doesnt stop moving,0,20,1,1,393
i cant get a control of it,0,210,1,1,5
turn turn turn,0,127,10,10,288
oh man that was right,0,30,9,9,484
i hit the left mouse button instead of the right,0,319,3,3,66
f alright just gonna let it hit me,0,681,2,2,237
p alright,0,26,1,1,10
get control,0,319,4,4,101
if you go super slow you make yourself vulnerable to the fortress and the mines,0,12,1,1,366
ok well i hope i get rid of all the negative points but i have expiring negative shots i cant slow down to whatever,0,569,6,6,209
q which is an unfriendly mine ok i just gotta hit it at the right interval,0,404,5,5,184
okay no control,0,818,6,6,128
alright that was probably pretty bad,0,190,6,6,193
slow down,0,51,8,8,315
gentle movements,0,52,2,2,525
go forward,0,55,7,7,875
please stop do,0,57,9,9,1383
okay turn around and got his way,0,56,8,8,114
go forward,0,20,1,1,403
go right,0,20,7,7,654
okay go forward,0,28,5,5,220
flying in circles,0,20,6,6,634
alright just a bonus once dollar sign pops up again got it alright points bonus,0,404,9,9,357
mumbles i got 3 4 4 alright still 4,0,372,5,5,68
slow down again,0,300,5,5,322
alright,0,16,3,3,211
ok slow down,0,569,3,3,176
alright,0,825,3,3,98
p so the controls have not switched up on me,0,53,9,9,397
turn and move,0,28,10,10,417
alright come on,0,16,8,8,630
its very difficult to get the rest of the game down until you learn to fly the thing thats the way i see it,0,127,2,2,208
ill probably get a good control score,0,825,10,10,300
alright im driftin lets get it,0,16,6,6,471
going a little slow,0,46,5,5,411
control control control,0,404,10,10,375
p alright the foe mines are y f and q,0,848,8,8,352
alright woah woah where are you going,0,53,5,5,218
get back inside the hexagon,0,300,7,7,370
these tight ass turns,0,16,5,5,388
first dollar sign there we go 38 shots left,0,130,10,10,432
no turn turn turn turn like that turn,0,113,1,1,326
alright lets ride,0,16,9,9,731
the optimal flight pattern that i had initially thought of is not the one im taking,0,12,2,2,411
alright,0,28,4,4,177
alright come on,0,16,10,10,807
alright the only way im going to win this is if i have the mine on my side,0,20,4,4,543
getting out of control first time i see the dollar sign friendly mine also on the screen,0,319,6,6,145
i kind of assumed that if i move my ship to the right that it would automatically go on a trail to the hold on like to the right but it does not,0,558,2,2,10
since the movement is so hard,0,12,5,5,520
p alright that was really frustrating because it kind of got stuck in an endless loop in between both sides,0,558,3,3,15
a meteorite flew right into it,0,127,10,10,290
lets take bonus points because i need all the help i can get really trying to slow down here,0,41,1,1,383
alright its like nope,0,647,2,2,162
forward,0,51,8,8,340
if i rotate slow enough i can get it,0,55,10,10,1038
forward,0,57,3,3,892
alright,0,319,2,2,28
so try to stasy in the hexagon but thats really hard tot do,0,12,1,1,346
alright were fine,0,33,3,3,542
one dollar sign move a little faster second dollar sign,0,14,10,10,846
and im out of control,0,28,8,8,341
slow down,0,454,6,6,212
i mumbles stop think about it,0,57,9,9,1408
slow interval and shoot,0,28,10,10,445
cant go backwards,0,51,6,6,224
alright,0,113,5,5,408
p okay so i think the main thing is to try to not get into hyperspace,0,468,1,1,10
slow down,0,51,10,10,422
forward rotating,0,300,4,4,311
oh no i feel like i might lose sanity for a bit just briefly,0,825,3,3,110
the mines go very fast as well,0,24,1,1,24
alright,0,788,6,6,182
set moving counterclockwise bwe thats a friendly shoot that one,0,910,1,1,15
thats too fast,0,12,6,6,558
so this is it is very hard to control,0,848,1,1,222
p youre right,0,3,3,3,53
ugh alright,0,473,7,7,301
no thats an enemy but i pressed it too fast,0,12,5,5,517
qcu qcu right click,0,52,10,10,868
efh gotta right that right click that and kill it,0,52,2,2,507
say in bounds,0,57,3,3,951
okay oh my god im going way too fast,0,818,1,1,13
slow down,0,28,2,2,105
flying off in random directions,0,14,9,9,831
dr and n right click,0,52,5,5,627
moving a bit fast dont like it dont like it dont like it,0,14,4,4,595
turn a little,0,57,3,3,891
turn and no,0,28,7,7,301
p lyv this is whether or not a mine is a foe so if it shows up on the iff counter at the bottom of the screen i have to if its one of those letters then it is a foe,0,681,1,1,188
aright shot,0,16,3,3,189
alright,0,16,2,2,141
p yeah this is my favorite strategy you lose points control wise but you make them back staying the hexagon half the time,0,977,6,6,96
okay move forward a little,0,57,4,4,1025
um this is very hard to control,0,739,1,1,9
p feel like im getting way more of a hang on these controls,0,400,6,6,130
well i got the interval right but i could not hit it,0,804,10,10,408
cant keep control of the ship but this is hard,0,804,2,2,252
alright,0,28,9,9,381
turn around aw man,0,818,10,10,253
alright go this way,0,51,3,3,58
second dollar sign going too fast,0,319,8,8,193
you know what were just gonna keep moving,0,14,3,3,550
nope mumbles alright,0,739,10,10,102
and its very frustrating because i cant control it the way i know i should be able to,0,127,5,5,245
im trying to control in this and im having a very hard time,0,20,1,1,390
p am i still using space bar,0,46,1,1,285
i almost went backwards maybe i did just slightly go backwards go backwards,0,155,2,2,201
just stay in the circle,0,51,4,4,103
i cant even slow this down,0,51,1,1,10
slow it down,0,28,5,5,208
now its aww man i couldve just fly out and get a second pass,0,57,9,9,1424
alright destroyed the fortress i have positive points finally i got 310,0,372,8,8,99
flying backwards,0,30,9,9,515
slowed down too much,0,3,6,6,112
g unfriendly ah im out of control ah man ok,0,404,10,10,379
in the hexagon,0,28,1,1,43
32 shots left continuing,0,910,4,4,108
get my moving down get my moving down,0,16,1,1,67
right click,0,52,10,10,863
i got the interval right but i didnt shoot it,0,24,3,3,87
slow down dude,0,53,1,1,29
alright box,0,16,2,2,101
wrapped the screen way too many times,0,319,7,7,187
p i still have 2 games left to play 3,0,685,8,8,163
cant control my speed so,0,910,5,5,125
the concept is simple but the controls are another story,0,804,2,2,255
slow your speed,0,51,6,6,180
and there you go i was right i dont know why i turned this like this maybe this is better,0,41,1,1,388
96 shots left,0,26,4,4,54
slow down slow down,0,28,1,1,24
i need to get moving so i dont get shot at,0,14,1,1,467
gimme that right back,0,16,6,6,452
p rzl for any and all ending in r oh iots so fast,0,12,1,1,343
26 shots left,0,26,3,3,31
i intended to avoid spardic flight pattens,0,12,6,6,551
to the right,0,818,6,6,121
thats a friendly mine but im moving really fast so i dont know if i can shoot it,0,3,7,7,122
i keep forgetting that the flight path is,0,54,5,5,375
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,6,6,466
its taking off velocity points,0,46,5,5,426
come on man how fast i gotta click,0,16,7,7,540
oh no i have to be inbounds i think,0,57,8,8,1339
stop doing that,0,51,4,4,97
gosh its like out of control,0,127,10,10,286
slightly forwards,0,55,3,3,657
alright we have to wait 250 milliseconds before each shot,0,20,5,5,566
i have lost all control at this point im just flying off now,0,14,3,3,559
at least this way i can get a little bit better get a feel for alright come on go,0,127,1,1,193
turn,0,51,5,5,160
just wrap the screen,0,432,3,3,161
alright k thats friendly,0,404,8,8,320
gotts stick and move stick and move,0,16,5,5,432
its just a lot of things like if i was just flying around and shooting i would be fine its just like im trying to look at the freaking reader and stuff and its just a lot i dont really know what you are and i have to remember it in my head but its not working,0,113,8,8,474
come on left hand,0,16,4,4,263
its frustrating i have to play with my left hand,0,658,6,6,54
alright here we go,0,28,1,1,53
alright im only on the ten point,0,16,8,8,656
so my screen warping is getting well better,0,825,3,3,125
alright so this is so annoying,0,113,4,4,396
as long as im moving ever so slightly i should umm,0,24,3,3,84
alright h,0,16,3,3,192
turn thrust,0,53,10,10,477
alright come on man,0,16,7,7,577
oh alright it repeats again,0,20,2,2,459
okay way to slow,0,34,2,2,101
no stop hitting me,0,14,4,4,603
i cant worry about the hexagon,0,432,3,3,159
i m choosing not to shoot right now because i dont have any bullets and i dont want to take negative points as im already doing,0,685,4,4,88
okay so 3 4 5 6 i dont wanna fly off,0,14,1,1,479
p im noticing im not really caring about the letters as much as staying in the circle,0,647,5,5,196
okay so im losing control,0,214,5,5,358
popped up right next to me,0,46,7,7,477
woah this is so hard to control,0,51,1,1,6
who says you need to go in circles to win,0,30,4,4,183
alright lets get it,0,16,3,3,250
i cant control this is killing me,0,404,1,1,39
im going to press the spacebar,0,20,1,1,385
alrighty come on fortress,0,454,3,3,171
p  alright you are going to stay on this bubble,0,113,9,9,492
forward,0,40,1,1,81
okay alright alright alright alright alright alright okay alright,0,113,2,2,336
its moving already,0,16,1,1,13
alright there we go,0,51,2,2,25
im gonna try it with the right hand,0,46,2,2,316
spinning around this thing its all about if youre going in one direction you press the thrust key,0,804,9,9,385
1 2 3 better control of the ship,0,647,4,4,191
going all over the screen,0,739,9,9,96
yup turn then move,0,16,6,6,447
just completely lost control may have died,0,818,2,2,31
alright alright alright,0,113,3,3,383
im just kinda going in circles,0,468,6,6,109
i cant never remember how fast i did these shoots,0,16,6,6,487
alright go forward,0,20,5,5,574
ive lost control this is when it gets bad,0,34,9,9,424
im not losing points for going to hyperspace but mumbles,0,468,4,4,48
i guess one of the things that i dont like is that it requires you to move in a pattern instead of just being able to fly around like you dont lose points if you fly around at least then you arent like more,0,411,9,9,136
p oh yea thats right i have to take care of the mines before i move on to the fortress,0,155,5,5,247
p i keep pulling it backwards but it doesnt work,0,50,2,2,18
slow down there,0,12,4,4,473
umm just trying to control the ship right now umm definitely definitely gaining some,0,468,6,6,102
cant shoot it too fast thats a friendly mine,0,404,2,2,75
alright come on come on,0,16,6,6,489
ah alright go around okay keep him there,0,210,3,3,36
gotta move a little bit faster,0,190,5,5,183
control,0,29,2,2,384
alright,0,51,7,7,285
p alright im trying to go in the counterclockwise flight path im like having trouble turning it,0,45,1,1,4
that was too fast,0,300,3,3,284
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1209
im pretty sure like with like the right control like 1000 points is definitely obtainable,0,825,5,5,160
left hand coordination is not working,0,46,4,4,383
alright trying to get into a good path,0,319,2,2,42
oops no no were gonna start flying around,0,818,5,5,92
alright go straight come on,0,210,6,6,82
right now i have 1000 which i think is just fantastic,0,558,1,1,5
its moving pretty fast,0,46,2,2,322
that thing follows me fast,0,51,3,3,71
alright oh wow youre an enemy,0,113,2,2,341
so the right speed is to keep going around in circles and not be shot at by the fortress but we still have mines we have to deal with which are q v and w for this game,0,848,10,10,394
alright,0,28,6,6,247
the less i turn i just i cant correct it not steer it,0,214,8,8,389
whats going on right now,0,739,4,4,42
alright,0,16,3,3,185
alright,0,16,4,4,342
turn and thrust turn and thrust,0,53,10,10,479
im in hyperspace getting followed by a mine which is definitely foe,0,468,6,6,111
as soon as you start the fortress gets hits on you for real like its just restarting up slow,0,804,3,3,258
so lets try to cancel out my normal points with the velocity points,0,34,10,10,483
and im going faster,0,411,6,6,98
damn every time i think i have the flight pattern down i dont,0,20,6,6,605
no left,0,51,10,10,428
and go forward,0,33,2,2,479
alright now lets try shooting at some stuff,0,28,1,1,38
just go slow,0,57,3,3,958
getting a little more control but unintelligible im not going to be doing so hot,0,804,6,6,306
unintelligible i just wish i wouldnt be going so fast,0,804,6,6,299
oh wait i think thats right,0,28,4,4,158
spacebar,0,54,9,9,436
i got a 9 right now,0,818,7,7,182
too slow,0,24,4,4,93
also moving the ship is kinda wonky it like requires you to turn it and accelerate it but the bad guy moves so much faster than you that its kinda hard to get a grip,0,411,9,9,140
its like the game knows when youre doing well and it just fires a thingy right at you,0,53,4,4,165
i gotta build up the vulnerability counter and try to move clockwise,0,681,1,1,194
im actually gaining hits on this thing ill get no control points but i think i can take the hit honestly how this game is so hard to control,0,404,2,2,83
going too fast going too fast,0,319,7,7,186
forward,0,55,5,5,762
mumbles clockwise mumbles alright,0,26,7,7,114
uhh yeah okay so same controls,0,53,4,4,142
inside the hexagon,0,49,9,9,478
p slow down slow down,0,50,4,4,48
slow slow and steady wins the race,0,30,3,3,142
so close slow down,0,825,4,4,143
going too fast going too fast,0,319,8,8,208
2 5 oh too fast dang it,0,211,10,10,132
oh enemy popped up right in my face,0,319,2,2,41
no stay out of hyperspace,0,818,7,7,164
alright thats it,0,16,8,8,635
p but you have to be inside the control zone,0,404,8,8,284
now im lost in hyperspace trying to gain control,0,468,7,7,144
actually the hardest thing is going forward,0,57,5,5,1042
nope im mustve did something right that time,0,20,10,10,801
theres a friendly on the screen,0,46,6,6,449
p im trying to go in the counterclockwise pathway but im struggling a little bit,0,45,1,1,5
so im staying my main strategy right now is to avoid the mine and im not staying in the hexagon very much because im trying to as much as i can but its hard,0,685,6,6,134
mumbles alright turn alright alright okay,0,113,3,3,375
alright,0,28,8,8,349
p oh right sorry,0,3,1,1,11
oh no turn and then thrust turn and then thrust,0,53,10,10,475
i dont like how it shoots me right awaythats all im saying,0,3,2,2,30
p now im going out of control,0,45,3,3,23
alright successful,0,825,4,4,147
p do you play left handed,0,569,1,1,152
okay you turn this way,0,113,3,3,372
see if i just screen wrap and kind of just stay in one horizontal err vertical line then that actually works pretty well for me,0,404,7,7,248
and a little bit forward,0,28,4,4,172
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1214
alright,0,16,3,3,219
if i could turn move move,0,57,10,10,1492
velocity is slightly faster than i would like,0,46,7,7,508
p oh ok alright,0,404,1,1,7
were gonna keep going to the right,0,818,8,8,202
p staying slow so far,0,300,8,8,373
come on move around,0,55,3,3,649
p center joystick top bottom thats right,0,53,3,3,93
circle around,0,319,2,2,34
i am getting close to 1200 so thats my goal right now,0,558,8,8,63
were just going to keep going to the right,0,818,5,5,87
okay im trying to control it,0,51,1,1,4
all right we have question mark,0,55,9,9,965
but i can just shoot that right yeah,0,52,6,6,673
slower slower,0,56,1,1,7
alright,0,28,5,5,228
cant waste this turn man i gotta learn how to move,0,16,8,8,676
im really just trying to get this thing to like allow me to control it but were not friends right now,0,47,1,1,8
alright whats next,0,16,4,4,324
turn turn,0,127,4,4,239
alright cool,0,28,8,8,359
alright buddy come on,0,568,3,3,65
you can only focus on one thing either destroying the mine or the fortress and then theres things shooting at you and then you have to think about not going into hyperdrive or hyperspace and the points and i dont even look at the points at times,0,53,7,7,310
turn around,0,57,7,7,1206
alright take my points and double shot,0,30,8,8,433
alright lemmy learn how to turn,0,16,4,4,274
umm its hard to control,0,372,1,1,4
managed to stay in the control zone a lot more,0,404,9,9,336
uh right 8,0,825,2,2,78
alright,0,558,10,10,76
umm but so i guess the what you were saying was like youre trying to accelerate in the,0,468,2,2,22
okay alright stop leaving stop leaving stop leaving the screen,0,113,4,4,388
back now inside the hexagon,0,300,6,6,340
keep trying to shoot too fast as well,0,12,3,3,439
slow down,0,51,5,5,150
alright,0,404,8,8,291
alright im at 10 again but im flying all over and i died,0,558,7,7,56
the screen went black,0,910,1,1,21
thats not the right key to fire,0,46,1,1,291
alright thats one,0,16,9,9,722
when it starts going too fast thats when it gets dangerous,0,34,7,7,333
right click that and i can kill it,0,52,3,3,541
im moving really fast,0,3,2,2,40
slow down,0,51,7,7,271
alright but i didnt get hit as much,0,16,4,4,341
go slower ok cool,0,211,8,8,113
alright i see what imma do,0,16,10,10,784
i think im going to track how fast it takes to shoot in between because it seems like it takes a break then shooting faster,0,400,2,2,112
its mhc here right now,0,404,8,8,326
i dint see the interval i think it was too fast,0,24,8,8,176
p slow down,0,50,9,9,111
im about to lose it so fast,0,155,5,5,242
basically alright im going to try this,0,51,2,2,36
slow down,0,51,6,6,216
alright,0,818,2,2,23
alright were gonna go out this way we can shoot now go straight clockwise he does not shoot you went youre going fast,0,818,1,1,12
cbe right click its gone,0,52,8,8,776
i swear the dollar sign appears right before im about to die,0,647,4,4,193
inaudible going way too fast but im outside the game ended,0,3,5,5,93
time my shots so theyre between the right millisecond intervals so it doesnt reset,0,681,1,1,199
getting too close to the edge keep moving,0,14,10,10,862
i could use that as a way to stop me,0,34,2,2,82
its kind of hard to keep out of hyperspace but oh the boss got me,0,804,2,2,247
yeah i definitely have to play the game like this at least 100 times just to get me in control of the space ship,0,127,1,1,195
i gotta get my muscle memory down as soon as i seen it to get the interval right,0,681,3,3,244
clockwise,0,54,5,5,376
alright thats two down,0,16,3,3,244
okay lets try to slow down here,0,14,6,6,705
alright,0,454,10,10,256
once you lose control its very hard to get it back,0,12,7,7,577
i should really stop starting to turn to try and get a cheap shot because im not going to turn fast enough to get a cheap shot,0,825,4,4,135
alright,0,568,1,1,15
turn,0,14,4,4,594
and slow down,0,28,8,8,344
going too fast,0,46,8,8,514
i can go forward,0,28,6,6,255
p yeah like sometimes its like harder to move around i dont think its the controls,0,211,6,6,84
alright we are almost there to destroy the fortress we are 7 currently,0,848,9,9,385
slow down,0,51,6,6,207
proabbly i stayed still too often to slow down,0,12,8,8,640
once i learn how to turn i swear ill get the game right,0,16,4,4,275
alright i should have got points instead of freaking shots,0,113,9,9,501
p k g y right,0,50,6,6,66
alright,0,319,1,1,8
alright well just r,0,16,3,3,240
your shipped wrapped around the screen 42 times,0,53,2,2,88
slow down,0,28,6,6,258
omg got it and then fortress which is right behind me,0,52,8,8,788
just flying all over the place,0,818,9,9,241
left click,0,51,6,6,220
first dollar sign going too fast,0,319,7,7,180
that was just too slow,0,432,5,5,173
go turn forward,0,28,6,6,239
shooting too fast thats a friendly mine,0,404,2,2,73
i gotta turn and boost turn boost turn boost turn boost turn boost,0,16,3,3,217
slow down,0,51,6,6,197
control control,0,454,5,5,199
alright uh,0,468,1,1,14
cbe right click no there not even mumbles cbe right click in the interval fire at it,0,52,8,8,787
alright,0,16,3,3,248
and its hard to go forward without going somewhere else at the same time,0,57,8,8,1347
so keep turn forward too much too much,0,28,2,2,100
slow down,0,51,7,7,234
alright lets go,0,685,3,3,46
i seem to do better when im moving because then the thing cant shoot me as much,0,54,5,5,392
alright were moving very slowly,0,28,2,2,99
trying the same strategy keep moving around,0,372,6,6,73
dont wrap the screen,0,51,6,6,191
p no like when i wrap the screen,0,211,7,7,102
yeah just keep going around in circles heh,0,113,2,2,359
ya know if i was good enough i could keep it in a circle that would be pretty cool,0,818,5,5,112
tryna avoid hyperspace now earlier in the game i wasnt,0,34,10,10,454
points is left,0,16,2,2,93
damn alright im just gonna ride,0,16,8,8,647
its hard to control it,0,54,4,4,357
forward,0,55,9,9,975
one bonus achieved still getting used to the controls since the ship does not slow down,0,804,3,3,259
p alright,0,647,10,10,245
lemmy slow down,0,16,1,1,17
mumbles go inside 50 36 shots left,0,26,9,9,153
mumbles clockwise,0,26,6,6,99
the speed is very hard to control but luckily we just got a second bonus or second dollar sign to receive the bonus,0,848,4,4,301
hold on slow down,0,56,7,7,94
keep hitting back on the control pad in order to stop the motion but i realize that it doesnt,0,404,2,2,77
i lost control of that,0,685,9,9,201
little circles,0,51,6,6,208
oh concentrate edgar like playing a mario game right now concentration is real,0,155,7,7,265
im in totally control i have relaxed everything in my body for some reason im not morphing out of control,0,825,8,8,246
control the ship,0,454,5,5,195
alright just uh huh,0,30,3,3,123
alright,0,404,7,7,247
i have 14 shots left i really need bonus shots,0,41,3,3,431
the trajectory,0,432,6,6,188
alright i got almost there,0,404,3,3,100
i lost control of it,0,788,3,3,164
mumbles thats a friendly mine right there,0,319,2,2,26
mine is on screen it is t,0,3,4,4,69
out of control,0,319,9,9,226
okay were just gonna keep going right,0,818,9,9,223
alright,0,454,2,2,160
alright gotta get a little bit faster,0,568,2,2,48
i wish when i moved to the right or the left it would go to the left or right,0,52,3,3,543
wow wow no no go in circles,0,113,10,10,525
rotate take my shots,0,14,2,2,521
cause most games now they like separate the direction from the moving,0,214,1,1,250
slow interval,0,28,10,10,450
the joystick is making it more confusing since i wanna go in the direction most free flowing but implementing is harder cause i wanna move forward,0,788,1,1,150
get control,0,454,2,2,161
its kind of off balance to control,0,210,1,1,9
dam those i thought i was slidin alright come on,0,16,5,5,380
get away from me personal space,0,53,10,10,495
its hard to stay in the hexagon,0,43,4,4,128
i think the best strategy ive figured out is just let it thrust one way and then just float and try not to get hit while you shoot the fortress,0,685,2,2,34
readjust move here,0,300,9,9,402
alright vulnerability 2 and he hit me thats enough,0,818,8,8,208
i was spinning around still trying to spin around the walls slowly just killed a mine so i was able to receive that vulnerability point,0,848,10,10,397
but due to my incredible maneuvering i cannot seem to line up a shot and the one time i do i seem to click it too rapidly which resets the vulnerability score so it is very frustrating,0,558,2,2,12
alright i just got killed,0,372,8,8,97
alright,0,28,4,4,166
turn around,0,57,7,7,1203
so we just circle around that,0,214,5,5,357
i mean once you get a good pace going its not too bad its just getting the thing under control is crazy,0,190,1,1,145
p umm im still like trying to get used to these controls cuz like sometimes when you try to turn to rotate it thrusts forward even though you dont intend to do that if that makes sense so sometimes it gets a little crazy,0,190,9,9,217
right click,0,52,5,5,623
now were going the right way,0,14,7,7,723
i know control vulnerability i forgot what interval means but its probably because i rarely hit a person,0,977,6,6,98
you geet used to everytime you respond you have to immediately move again,0,12,3,3,436
ok so i feel more in control of my actions and less of like i dont know whats going on but still trying to stay inside the lines,0,468,3,3,33
this could turn someone off to gaming completely,0,214,3,3,314
also slow down,0,12,3,3,453
four oh were moving now,0,20,4,4,530
and im flying all over the place,0,190,7,7,199
p ok ok thats right,0,411,1,1,4
forward,0,57,5,5,1061
basically lost control there,0,14,9,9,832
i think its actually impossible to fly in the circle,0,3,1,1,18
ok so i may not be staying in the middle as much as i want to but i definitely feel more in control of my movements,0,468,7,7,164
how do i move this over here,0,658,1,1,8
im waiting for the 250 millisecond interval and nothing alright,0,20,4,4,549
so once i get it under control mumbles take back,0,432,7,7,193
mumbling letters at beginning screen oqi oqi,0,404,5,5,176
alright jyq,0,16,5,5,347
okay oh okay now i understand so forward is forward and im just moving left and right  if i wanna decrease the speed i actually dont know how to do that,0,468,1,1,8
move in a straight line and shoot,0,300,2,2,275
alright qhd lets go,0,568,1,1,5
oops mumbles alright,0,319,2,2,43
two personal space,0,53,6,6,257
shot way to fast couldve gotten it,0,34,4,4,212
going extremely fast in this game,0,34,1,1,17
turn,0,28,6,6,271
maybe i should stay in here and try and move back,0,29,8,8,556
turn and slow down,0,28,3,3,136
alright,0,16,1,1,24
got hit right away,0,46,7,7,470
stay on the screen come on man,0,739,5,5,55
i need to start moving,0,14,5,5,631
getting used to the sensitivity but i completely expect that once the controls change it will be difficult all over again,0,12,3,3,451
get back into the hexagon,0,300,10,10,423
control the ship,0,454,3,3,169
slow it down,0,454,2,2,155
still cant control this thing,0,26,4,4,52
i guess the rotation is just so fast for me its difficult,0,127,6,6,258
and i have it right within what i need,0,34,4,4,166
turn around,0,28,2,2,74
turn,0,51,5,5,158
and hes moving faster than usual it seems like,0,20,3,3,474
move,0,55,3,3,654
trying to do this with my left hand is definitely hindering my point game,0,818,3,3,38
alright,0,825,1,1,11
p alright this time im finishing positive,0,16,5,5,345
control your speed,0,51,6,6,183
okay i didnt know that those mines could move,0,51,1,1,13
slow it down,0,28,5,5,207
p alright so lets youuu,0,28,3,3,122
rotate rotate rotate come on rotate go,0,127,1,1,197
p slow down bonus missiles,0,50,9,9,108
that velocity scored points are like nothing cause i keep dying,0,12,1,1,373
alright,0,16,8,8,613
actually even though if i stay it just for some reason starts putting me towards the hexagon,0,57,4,4,1022
alright,0,28,5,5,211
not even the dexterity of this but the fact that i dont do well lefthanded,0,127,3,3,229
im kind of spinning right now,0,468,8,8,179
but its harder to control because i cant pull up,0,41,1,1,363
alright same shit,0,16,9,9,685
alright this joystick,0,16,1,1,23
okay so now turn to me okay so that didnt work okay,0,113,4,4,401
it helps if i screen wrap but i know that messes with points oh see went to fast there,0,404,6,6,220
alright its getting a little easier now,0,685,7,7,153
i am going way to fast and it is tough right now,0,34,1,1,46
im able to stay in the control zone a little bit better this time,0,404,2,2,57
we are spinning out of control lets try and even it back out,0,848,1,1,232
okay were positive right now,0,34,4,4,163
clockwise position,0,300,6,6,339
this game is like slowly destroying my confidence at playing games,0,411,6,6,99
g into hyper space,0,14,9,9,805
i feel like im going fast,0,46,1,1,294
i was just staying in the hexagon how did i do that,0,52,3,3,565
nope no i just did a complete circle for some reason,0,818,6,6,138
slow down,0,51,7,7,254
ziu i wanna do that again slow down,0,41,6,6,497
im just flying in space not doing anything right now,0,372,1,1,7
all right good,0,55,6,6,806
i wasnt going too fast i stayed inside the hexagon flying maybe the wrong way but mumbles umm yeah so,0,468,5,5,82
ok mumbling alright got a friendly on the screen take him down ok,0,404,9,9,356
so weird trying to stay slow stay within the hexagon and just circle around the fortress it seems to have forgotten how to shoot,0,848,6,6,325
oh that is a friend alright alright,0,20,7,7,672
no turn,0,33,9,9,844
alright,0,28,9,9,385
im just trying to get the hang of the control,0,404,4,4,165
alright so i cant really stay in the,0,130,4,4,302
trying to control it,0,130,1,1,235
okay so my control was terrible,0,34,4,4,213
i was too slow on the interval that time to get the mine,0,681,3,3,247
is that two yep let me get those yeah right back,0,16,6,6,451
i tryinna slow down and shit,0,16,8,8,664
alright that is a d,0,16,6,6,442
speed a little too fast,0,46,7,7,471
i think oh didnt happen this time alright,0,558,3,3,16
getting used to the controls now,0,432,8,8,203
my ship wrapped around the screen 45 times,0,658,1,1,19
forward,0,55,3,3,656
dangit i keep flying right into him,0,16,4,4,314
slow down,0,51,7,7,282
alright,0,26,3,3,21
slow across the screen straight,0,300,10,10,421
the fort moves slower than i do,0,12,2,2,408
okay now im movin way too fast,0,16,2,2,168
so lets turn,0,54,3,3,352
and turn again,0,28,2,2,76
uh its getting out the screen,0,739,10,10,104
moving too fast again,0,12,2,2,416
trying to slow down,0,130,8,8,361
lets see right now im just trying to decelerate by going in the opposite direction but its really hard,0,130,5,5,306
like i dont know some people cut their steak with their right hand and then they switch hands to like scoop rice or whatever,0,53,4,4,159
its almost impossible to go slow,0,24,1,1,20
thrust left right,0,16,2,2,97
im going backwards,0,468,4,4,52
move,0,14,1,1,468
space fortress is mumbles enemy mine,0,319,7,7,175
alruight right right,0,20,7,7,653
its not like when you get hit by the missiles and the screen starts but its like the mine hits you it freezes,0,818,6,6,133
too slow,0,41,9,9,604
i have no control whatsoever,0,804,6,6,304
but if my theory still proves true as soon as i get the hang of this theyll switch the controls on me,0,53,4,4,184
alright so bouncing off the middle seems to send me in the opposite direction so its not a good way to slow me down,0,468,8,8,178
ah turn turn turn turn  mumbling,0,210,4,4,43
slow slow ah of course,0,53,4,4,164
its just so hard to keep up with everything at the bottom because it changes so much the game just moves so quickly,0,211,9,9,129
p alright good maybe ill get a little better,0,685,1,1,23
i only got 13 shots left,0,54,4,4,362
alright heres the thing,0,28,2,2,67
okay were at 5 right now,0,34,5,5,241
alright alright alright,0,113,10,10,523
x friendly mine try to shoot it alright just hit it,0,404,7,7,268
that hexagon,0,52,10,10,893
alright mine down,0,28,5,5,213
p alright alright oh this is not easier not at all,0,113,1,1,309
definitely try tookay already going counterclockwise,0,468,8,8,188
alright this is very sensitive,0,28,2,2,96
alright get the points,0,51,10,10,453
i wish backwards could do something,0,52,4,4,578
oh i am clicking too slow on the intervals with the enemy enemy mines,0,404,7,7,256
hey alright mumbles,0,30,6,6,291
right,0,26,2,2,13
alright i it was ezekiel so thats a friend,0,20,8,8,707
lemmy rotate to it,0,14,7,7,748
stops game,0,739,1,1,5
its very slippery im staying outside of the control line a lot which is very difficult to stay in and when it starts immediately and the fortress gets off the first shot that i really cannot avoid,0,404,1,1,21
oh too fast there we go,0,211,1,1,10
i shot too fast that time i can tell,0,12,2,2,392
and it seems to be just the right speed for the bullets to not be able to hit me unless directly facing the fortress,0,848,5,5,310
actually managing to get off a lot of shots im at 6 right now,0,404,3,3,114
just one time just one time just go fast,0,155,1,1,191
turn then move,0,16,6,6,498
were flying off to fast too fast,0,14,6,6,703
right click shoot at it,0,52,2,2,519
so much for control points,0,12,6,6,541
turn around bang,0,20,8,8,721
i think the shots are based how fast you move vertically,0,400,3,3,119
okay screen just went black,0,34,1,1,50
p the directions for moving the ship sound a lot easier than they do on paper,0,977,2,2,83
p alright hit me,0,33,2,2,455
p  ok same controls,0,53,5,5,194
im getting better at identifying the foes and double clicking the correct time interval and i just took the points and i shouldve took the shots because i only have 3 left,0,685,9,9,197
alright theres the bonus 1 bonus 2 for the points,0,404,10,10,385
damn these shits movin faster,0,16,5,5,424
turn around,0,127,7,7,265
mmm if i go too fast it doesnt even shoot at me so thats good,0,404,10,10,384
aright im probably having a harder time with this,0,38,1,1,154
i definitely feel like if it was more of like an arcade stick with buttons it would be easy but this joystick is not the right thing for it this is for like planes,0,217,2,2,66
slow down,0,46,8,8,516
p i just dont remember if its right,0,3,3,3,56
alright you my friend,0,16,3,3,193
trying to avoid this hyper space is harder than i thought,0,210,6,6,81
ive been getting the most points for control really,0,12,5,5,536
i have no control over this,0,29,9,9,583
okay trying trying to go slowly,0,24,1,1,39
uh how does it expect you to stay within the circle,0,825,3,3,101
you cant kill it if theres a mine on the screen,0,130,5,5,309
no that was left alright,0,20,7,7,681
right away speeds a little too fast,0,46,6,6,440
i aint cluch with the right clicks,0,16,9,9,750
haha i think my ultimate strategy here is to really not even worry about the control zone because it is so hard to stay in,0,404,2,2,78
if i actually ended up flying a plane,0,113,7,7,469
alright i still got my points,0,16,9,9,730
hyperspace someone is following me,0,468,8,8,187
turn and go,0,28,7,7,313
p stay inside this hexagon,0,50,6,6,64
perfect we got a good velocity that hes not shooting for some reason,0,848,9,9,372
p alright,0,739,1,1,6
uh i cant even keep it on the screen,0,739,2,2,26
alright come on,0,16,9,9,701
lemmy get this moving down,0,16,1,1,45
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,6,6,438
alright so im going to fast and i need to control that,0,54,3,3,351
turn it yea yea,0,214,5,5,349
i need to learn how to move,0,16,8,8,654
going too fast going too fast,0,319,9,9,221
circles will not get me wins,0,30,5,5,257
no i was too slow,0,34,3,3,124
alright so its supposed to be a long wait then,0,16,9,9,745
um slow slow hey,0,53,4,4,166
alright camera help me memorize that,0,49,7,7,401
tries to shoot slowly,0,300,8,8,381
p alright,0,190,8,8,214
alright onf alright i can do that,0,16,1,1,8
i can also feel the snap back if you dont position the joystick back to neutral like a game controller,0,468,3,3,38
turn,0,33,10,10,856
alright friendly mine,0,28,5,5,215
slow down,0,51,3,3,73
i have to go in a different direction to go slower,0,57,3,3,927
slow down,0,300,4,4,310
alright o thats a friendly,0,404,10,10,386
hyperspace,0,28,4,4,176
going too fast i see the dollar sign and an enemy mine,0,319,7,7,168
alright alright alright,0,404,6,6,240
figuring out which way to turn is like i think thats an enemy mine we can shoot it,0,130,1,1,241
so now im just going to try to fly around and avoid everything so i can get shots,0,685,9,9,198
straight straight left ok straight oh that didnt work out,0,20,7,7,673
oh slow,0,28,7,7,305
its just its just i cant get any type of control,0,57,9,9,1376
slow down,0,51,9,9,366
no were just gonna lose complete control,0,818,7,7,184
alright i might as well just use my shit,0,16,4,4,296
im supposed to be staying in the hexagon,0,20,3,3,509
alright ok oh no,0,53,2,2,70
alright that was all ten,0,30,10,10,585
im slow at distance,0,300,10,10,417
okay this is not working right,0,113,5,5,426
trying to slow that down,0,130,2,2,248
its just that nothing really comes to mind other than trying to move,0,910,1,1,14
stop,0,24,1,1,40
i got to walk faster,0,432,1,1,140
learn how to move,0,16,8,8,671
come on go forward,0,55,2,2,603
okay not doing too hot on this one on velocity or anything either,0,34,10,10,477
just control,0,300,2,2,278
mumbles alright and sometimes you just go too slow,0,190,9,9,218
and then once i got the hang of it i got to shoot it i need to just stay inside the hexagon,0,130,5,5,316
slower and clockwise,0,28,8,8,350
tqj alright yes,0,404,4,4,136
fik so fast,0,130,9,9,400
slow down going way to fast,0,34,4,4,203
oh that was my worst score right there,0,558,10,10,77
slow down,0,53,2,2,69
slow down,0,51,9,9,371
its like trying to go slow and steady now just messes you up,0,411,5,5,77
p so this is nothing right here txh,0,26,1,1,3
you know i havent been looking at the interval thing i just hope i got it right,0,400,4,4,123
p trying to keep a handle on the control there,0,210,1,1,8
alright nice fire fire,0,20,2,2,426
its so risky to slow down,0,12,2,2,406
turn,0,28,1,1,28
go straight make a left,0,20,7,7,655
alright so i think i got a strategy going,0,568,3,3,68
shoot okay alright umm i think im starting to get a little better doing the thrusting and all that stuff trying to keep it on the screen a little bit better,0,685,1,1,18
im going a bit too fast right now but you know live and learn,0,41,8,8,576
alright 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 destroyed it,0,372,6,6,76
turn turn,0,127,10,10,289
forward,0,57,3,3,911
turn and move,0,16,4,4,277
so we are going to try and mimic what we did last game and slowly spinning within the hexagon basically the purpose of the game,0,848,10,10,392
okay thats fast,0,51,3,3,59
you can kinda gat a clue its hard to notice when youre in hyper space,0,977,9,9,113
go this way alright go this way alright alright no stop stop,0,113,2,2,352
oh out of control now,0,319,3,3,54
alright three minutes its done,0,53,10,10,498
okay clockwise not too fast i could probably do a lot better with my right hand but yes shoot it,0,818,2,2,18
slow slow down,0,404,4,4,145
alright this is a little bit easier to control,0,372,2,2,22
control is negative but that was really bad,0,46,7,7,509
thats weird i didnt notice the fortress was spinning within the octagon or hexagon whatever,0,211,5,5,69
ah alright so if i boom boom boom,0,20,4,4,517
when i try to go forward it almost goes left as well,0,57,2,2,794
mumblesalright,0,788,1,1,148
or stop missing,0,3,7,7,139
i need to turn,0,33,9,9,831
mumbles see im out of control now,0,404,4,4,163
i seem to be losing a lot of control points,0,34,5,5,250
move alright,0,910,1,1,18
alright,0,16,1,1,44
i was thinking yea move forward and then no,0,214,5,5,356
okay so for this one im just going to try and wrap the screen as many times as possible and just shoot when i have the opportunity,0,372,5,5,58
at 5 vulnerability friendly mine right there,0,319,2,2,29
there we go and now just turn and a little bit of speed,0,51,2,2,38
forward,0,57,3,3,889
i think im right bro,0,49,9,9,461
and i dont know how much times left,0,685,10,10,225
kay too fast too fast too fast okay were just gonna keep going this way,0,14,7,7,743
i am at 478 right now only 61 shots left,0,372,3,3,41
we have 1 2 3 4 5 so hard to like gain control after you lose it,0,647,7,7,223
because i was doing the thing too slow i need to get between the things,0,41,7,7,521
p ok my question is i might just not umm been hitting the enemy fortress but once i got to ten i was trying to hit it with two shots and uh it seemed to be going right through it,0,404,5,5,192
alright,0,404,8,8,304
slow down a bit,0,34,9,9,439
yeah i think that my problem is that i prioritize it trying to stay on the screen so the mouse doesnt factor into this for me,0,47,3,3,34
p yeah like maybe i should try shooting some more but just wanna get the control thing first down so you like,0,468,3,3,44
gotta try to develop my strategy on the go im not worried about control until that last hit i guess,0,404,5,5,203
turn and go,0,28,2,2,98
p i gotta use my left hand,0,16,4,4,261
lost a lot on control and velocity,0,46,6,6,466
okay so doing good on velocity,0,34,9,9,434
alright,0,28,10,10,435
p yeah umm i wrapped the screen 32 times definitely better upgrade,0,568,2,2,53
trying to get a hang of the controls first,0,681,1,1,204
alright im gonna do this,0,404,7,7,245
and i still cant control this ship because it has a mind of its own,0,20,1,1,399
well were doing good in points right now which is good,0,34,9,9,415
i cant get into the circle,0,38,3,3,182
oh fly this way,0,20,5,5,569
its like a slow time on the mumbles i dont think ive destroyed this thing once,0,432,2,2,151
counterclockwise huh maybe i was wrong,0,53,3,3,94
slow oh alright,0,30,3,3,143
moving it there,0,300,8,8,382
alright off to a bad start,0,155,10,10,296
alright,0,28,4,4,165
p definitely cant go clockwise as easy as i could,0,18,1,1,33
alright i have control now,0,825,8,8,245
well just slowly coast along,0,14,9,9,827
uh thats friendly but i cannot slow down enough to shoot it,0,3,5,5,80
i dont find myself caring about the hexagon anymore just focusing on the fortress,0,432,3,3,158
p alright alright come on,0,454,3,3,165
mine popped up right in front of me,0,55,1,1,520
focus and go back clockwise,0,300,7,7,359
i think i have better control on this one but the other is easier for shooting,0,18,7,7,43
i dont know how im supposed to shoot the means because im just freaking flying dumb flight path,0,20,3,3,502
im doing good with mines and going off the screen,0,51,5,5,172
this would be a lot easier i did not expect that to move like that,0,27,1,1,11
fast fast go around,0,210,4,4,45
come on go fly through come on fly through,0,127,2,2,206
okay left turn,0,27,1,1,10
at least i destroyed it its not fast this is good,0,211,9,9,125
p they keyboard felt more of a game and this feels like im just shooting makes me want to spam the shoot button cause of the way its moving its more precise,0,217,8,8,80
go go i think i have 61 shots left so i just need to somehow get the extra missiles,0,130,1,1,237
p alright here we go,0,47,6,6,80
i keep spinning instead of going forward,0,57,7,7,1223
we cannot lose these points right now,0,20,9,9,756
i love how it just wants you to fly around the hexagon but like yea no,0,53,1,1,25
its a lot faster paced than i thought it would be for sure,0,404,1,1,26
alright,0,454,2,2,143
p i keep pulling backwards on the joystick even though it doesnt work,0,50,7,7,82
i cant really slow down and now i can,0,569,6,6,204
oh no too fast too fast,0,818,4,4,75
back to the controlling thing forward on the joystick is still move forward even when youre ship is pointed in every direction because it doesnt make sense,0,977,10,10,117
i had the flight plan down but yeah it took a long time,0,20,10,10,810
turn around turn around make a right for forward,0,20,6,6,615
okay so if its lrg stop it,0,825,3,3,89
im really just going for control almost,0,404,5,5,187
p oh ok its moving very fast,0,211,1,1,3
going too fast,0,28,10,10,411
im more of a controller person,0,53,2,2,58
i just entered hyper,0,14,3,3,549
dang man i be movin too fast for me to shoot this thing,0,16,3,3,220
slow down,0,12,4,4,476
stay on the screen,0,739,7,7,74
alright i definitely just definitely energized that,0,404,1,1,34
alright r friendly mine got the hit,0,404,7,7,270
okay so im gonna float through space the quickest,0,113,1,1,317
so trying to go slower than usual and stay within the boundaries,0,848,5,5,306
looking slowly to the right,0,300,4,4,302
control the ship,0,454,5,5,191
turn this way,0,57,7,7,1210
im doing it too fast,0,52,5,5,666
i need to stop going into hyperspace,0,53,6,6,275
ive watched dragon ball z this is the easiest,0,825,8,8,234
wait ok i lost control,0,210,2,2,20
sorry didnt fly it,0,53,2,2,50
p slower slow,0,50,4,4,38
accelerating left,0,910,3,3,82
alright damn,0,16,2,2,161
p alright lets do this,0,568,3,3,60
forward ok,0,52,1,1,432
slow down,0,51,2,2,24
forward oh this is so difficult,0,52,1,1,434
im not moving forward anymore,0,788,2,2,156
no dont lose control yet,0,685,4,4,85
i dont like these controls already,0,14,1,1,448
alright come on come on come on come on,0,16,6,6,460
okay one shot left,0,29,6,6,511
i really dont know how to slow down and i cant seem to aim really at all,0,558,1,1,4
of course it hits me when i went into hyperspace i didnt know what was gonna come out there,0,804,10,10,400
alright it blacked out,0,210,1,1,13
you warped the screen 7 times,0,14,3,3,581
p alright,0,910,1,1,22
p alright bonus,0,51,10,10,396
oh i gotta slow down,0,34,2,2,65
alright lemmy go my other way,0,16,7,7,537
turn,0,56,4,4,50
uh t that didnt matter i just ran right into it,0,825,2,2,77
alright i really want to get the flight path down,0,20,3,3,498
oh right at 2 oh well,0,569,8,8,229
turn shoot,0,28,9,9,392
i need to learn how to control my velocity,0,51,2,2,34
slow down,0,51,3,3,56
p yeah that seems to be the best course here cause trying to go in a circle like it wants me to is just kinda frustrating,0,411,10,10,145
oh going too fast,0,319,4,4,81
alright here we go,0,28,10,10,409
my control has gotten a lot better,0,788,5,5,179
alright managed to hit the enemy got the vulnerability 1 vulnerability 2,0,404,7,7,254
one personal space two personal space,0,53,3,3,113
alright,0,372,9,9,114
i completely lost control,0,788,3,3,166
i was going too fast last time,0,130,2,2,245
too fast,0,12,6,6,563
unintelligible im getting bonus points because im not going into hyperspace that much,0,804,6,6,297
alright so how im onna do this,0,16,3,3,258
way too fast,0,46,6,6,455
turn then move,0,16,6,6,499
p the only thing is wrapping the screen i just cant really avoid it its one or the other if i cant control it then,0,404,4,4,122
forward,0,57,3,3,890
alright right now im just trying to not mumbles,0,468,1,1,12
okay im going way to fast with the speed,0,34,4,4,177
just trying to get control of the game,0,404,1,1,19
no cant control,0,210,6,6,88
gotta get control stop moving so fast,0,214,4,4,320
okay go forward,0,51,5,5,157
alright aw i thought i should aim,0,113,2,2,362
too fast,0,41,10,10,640
yeah another im going in circles outside of the lines,0,468,6,6,126
im trying to slow down,0,12,8,8,620
up turn,0,14,4,4,612
okay i gotta turn then move,0,16,6,6,497
13 shots left,0,26,5,5,81
ok that was right,0,411,3,3,38
ah moving pretty fast now i gotta slow down a bit,0,404,3,3,102
which means i have to go in a circle,0,29,6,6,512
next time i see the dollar buttons im going to click left,0,468,4,4,60
ah no trying to stay inside the hexagon,0,468,5,5,78
alright,0,825,2,2,51
that was too fast,0,788,3,3,165
first dollar sign and second one shots oh no that was too fast,0,130,1,1,239
oh i didnt know i was on top of the screen,0,113,9,9,498
enemy mine going way too fast,0,319,5,5,124
alright this oh oh,0,20,4,4,513
im on level 10 h too fast,0,211,8,8,112
not the right interval messed up going too fast,0,319,6,6,161
too fast,0,24,1,1,32
alright one dollar sign waiting for the next,0,20,4,4,539
mumbles out of control,0,319,4,4,105
d friendly im in a bad spot ah man im not going very fast but not slow either,0,404,6,6,234
alright,0,28,10,10,422
i need to control better,0,52,2,2,494
rotate and pass him by,0,300,2,2,274
it keeps stuttering a little bit sometimes which doesnt affect the play all that much but is kind of jarring when youre moving really fast and then you hit a mine and then the whole screen freezes,0,818,6,6,132
that was too fast,0,14,3,3,577
negative velocity points,0,46,5,5,427
p im dead right now,0,40,1,1,80
ohhh right on time,0,53,9,9,443
alright,0,28,5,5,224
go forward,0,51,5,5,159
alright,0,454,7,7,233
alright im gonna find a way to make this work,0,113,1,1,323
a lot faster than i thought it would be,0,910,1,1,5
i lost control,0,300,10,10,420
ive lost control right now,0,34,10,10,469
control the ship,0,454,6,6,208
alright fxd are the enemy mines,0,319,3,3,48
p okay umm so im just trying to control the ship right now im getting a tiny better but still not really able to go the other way but still  umm so yeah i think this will take some getting used to,0,468,2,2,19
no i have to move i cant just sabotage this,0,52,4,4,590
lemmy learn how to turn,0,16,4,4,287
im enjoying the fact that at least my spaceship goes like an actual airplane  its delightful to see,0,804,5,5,282
strategy of just flying randomly,0,30,3,3,139
it is so hard to stay in bounds,0,16,1,1,54
ok now start trying to control a little bit more,0,404,8,8,306
go forward,0,51,5,5,162
oh i just oh thats right because it totals all the scores,0,12,5,5,535
alright okay okay,0,28,5,5,200
this is much harder to control,0,14,1,1,444
alright,0,16,5,5,406
i cant slow down well that worked,0,569,5,5,198
alright were good now,0,33,6,6,661
cbe right click in the interval,0,52,8,8,751
its a bad one my interval was too fast no that was the second one,0,130,4,4,290
however my velocity is at 1,0,130,4,4,293
i dont care if i keep going into hyperspace i just need to get this vulnerability,0,34,3,3,147
this is going way too fast,0,739,1,1,10
p slow down slow down,0,50,10,10,133
im going way too fast,0,3,5,5,84
stay out of the bounds,0,47,10,10,136
no we just lost control again,0,818,8,8,212
gotta stop hitting that though,0,57,6,6,1148
moving better,0,214,7,7,379
if i could even control it at all,0,404,1,1,40
too fast too fast,0,56,4,4,49
let me just keep going to the right,0,818,8,8,209
turn,0,28,10,10,462
forward,0,57,7,7,1229
so keep moving and just fly straight into it thats,0,14,7,7,751
yep i was right dont need that,0,454,8,8,241
slightly slower than last time,0,46,2,2,327
stop stop,0,411,8,8,115

i must have went too fast or didnt react fast enough,0,12,9,9,653
right now i am trying to work with my old uh whats it called plan of spinning within the circle very slowly,0,848,2,2,248
moving too fast,0,12,4,4,479
its spinning so fast,0,211,2,2,24
its really hard to control this guy,0,47,2,2,21
p try to keep control here,0,50,10,10,123
yeah because even if i do control im not shooting anything,0,57,7,7,1219
im just going to go like that points up screen and its going to go up continuously,0,53,8,8,378
and it seems that sometimes he doesnt shoot me but sometimes he does like depending on where i am on the screen,0,47,10,10,145
p another important this is to move away when it first starts the game at least cause you get hit that first time,0,432,10,10,216
go forward,0,55,2,2,565
forward,0,55,7,7,872

dont judge me on my knowledge of quails,0,53,10,10,468
right click interval,0,52,4,4,610
alright,0,16,7,7,575
going too fast,0,46,9,9,568
p alright,0,910,1,1,13
p im trying to slow this ship down and tilt it a little bit forward but it keeps going faster which really sucks,0,411,4,4,53

ok take it slowly there you go nope come back,0,210,5,5,51
get this one game right,0,16,8,8,657
14 shots left,0,26,3,3,39
p if you try and keep track of reading the scorecard at the bottom like the control and velocity and you take your concentration off the game for a second it feels like you have for minutes theres some rounds like this one where you hope you die because its a lost cause and want to start over,0,977,4,4,91
okay i wrapped around the ship screen less times and i was damaged more times,0,55,2,2,609
alright all done,0,190,10,10,229
stop moving stop moving,0,16,4,4,308
too fast too fast too fast too fast,0,14,2,2,509
alright,0,28,1,1,44
if i can control this ting im just going in circles,0,569,8,8,230
oh theres a mine on screen i think its friendly,0,3,10,10,226
when i see that on the screen i double right click,0,52,2,2,478
okay so right now friend okay,0,34,1,1,22
cant seem to get it to go right,0,804,3,3,260
slow down,0,51,6,6,201
it feels like the joystick is moving up but i dont know,0,788,1,1,151
umm ah back in hyperspace,0,468,7,7,149
alright,0,319,4,4,79
p okay i keep losing control almost immediately and i am having a lot of trouble slowing down,0,558,4,4,19
mumbles alright,0,26,6,6,97
your ship warped through the screen 29 times,0,825,1,1,42
p okay its pretty hard just feel like umm just doing this with my left hand is pretty difficult,0,319,1,1,5
turn toward,0,28,7,7,290
yep alright okay cool,0,30,8,8,418
i got it right there,0,16,1,1,73
get some decent points velocity,0,46,9,9,590
turn,0,28,2,2,80
well the mines move really fairly slow enough to react if youre not flying into hyperspace,0,12,2,2,399
the hardest part i think as well is not wrapping around the screen because it makes it easier but you lose points by doing that,0,685,2,2,41
i even drew a flight pattern i knew when to turn,0,53,10,10,480
and move out of my way,0,14,2,2,524
bad mine kill it there we go no slow down 37 more bullets,0,130,8,8,371
