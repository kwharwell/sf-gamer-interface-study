trying to move inch by inch but its so hard to do,0,12,5,5,529
slow down,0,131,2,2,35
im dead flying off in random direction that was quick,0,14,3,3,514
alright,0,685,1,1,6
alright umm see a mine i hit it head on it disappeared so im guessing it didnt do damage and its friendly,0,468,7,7,151
stop moving stop moving,0,16,4,4,308
alright,0,28,1,1,4
see im already at 500 but i didnt even realize cuz my control is at positive velocity and points for the whole negative,0,49,8,8,455
p im still struggling to fly in a counterclockwise direction and im also out of the hexagon and now im waiting for the next mine its k which means its a friend but i dont think im supposed to shoot it cause its a friend,0,45,3,3,20
try to do a fly by,0,818,6,6,146
slow down,0,51,5,5,150
hey stop alright alright alright alright just die die,0,113,5,5,397
so now we got a little more movement so i think i can start to incorporate everything else,0,214,8,8,352
got the bonus right just gotta shoot it,0,404,4,4,152
you know what i have left im going to make them useful,0,113,6,6,424
ok that was right,0,411,3,3,38
whatcha alright come here,0,16,10,10,770
turn go straight,0,210,10,10,169
im actually at negative points right now,0,568,1,1,19
alright so first dollar sign wow daf,0,130,7,7,354
alright,0,214,2,2,222
this is virtually impossible i cant get myself to control this thing,0,214,1,1,184
slow down,0,51,7,7,234
this stick is really alright,0,568,1,1,23
slow down a bit,0,34,9,9,439
its very hard to control,0,404,1,1,10
i can actually control it a little bit,0,190,1,1,111
i just feels weird using a joystick to control a little stick plane,0,43,1,1,121
uh thrusters off,0,57,1,1,847
slow down,0,14,3,3,527
its a foe and i didnt even realize fast enough,0,49,8,8,454
p okay look stop there you go,0,214,4,4,276
okay i need to stop dying,0,113,2,2,305
and i cant even turn,0,16,4,4,294
its moving already,0,16,1,1,13
its tripping and i circle it,0,49,9,9,486
alright so,0,54,4,4,263
it doesnt really give you time to think because it moves so fast,0,977,1,1,54
alright come on,0,16,4,4,285
okay i can turn this way,0,16,7,7,516
i cant move throughout the hexagon,0,130,9,9,406
i dont know how im supposed to shoot the means because im just freaking flying dumb flight path,0,20,3,3,502
slow down,0,127,10,10,282
shooting as i move across it,0,300,10,10,411
staying inside the hexagon pretty well this time,0,809,6,6,103
yeah im flying all over the place here,0,127,2,2,158
alright stick and move,0,16,4,4,326
this is the 5th game and i still have not mastered the flight pattern,0,20,5,5,558
i pressed that too fast,0,12,4,4,487
slow down,0,51,7,7,256
too fast,0,56,7,7,108
alright buddy come on,0,568,3,3,65
thats my last chance right here,0,49,9,9,492
alright qhd lets go,0,568,1,1,5
i didnt not realize that there would be acceleration in this which kind of makes it tougher,0,400,1,1,53
im able to stay in the control zone a little bit better this time,0,404,2,2,57
ill just take that hit i guess and control for it,0,12,9,9,657
yeah the problem is the velocity points i cant even slow it down,0,127,5,5,199
p um yeah im kinda trying to get it to go as slow as i can because it moves very fast,0,211,2,2,30
mumbles alright,0,568,1,1,16
all right lets do this,0,55,9,9,982
p so the controls have not switched up on me,0,53,9,9,397
oh enter thats right,0,33,1,1,560
moving toward the fortress,0,300,1,1,206
tell her to slow down,0,131,2,2,52
p alright,0,16,2,2,90
i keep going in circles,0,468,6,6,132
alright come on,0,16,8,8,670
thats a foe but i didnt do it fast enough,0,49,8,8,461
slow down slow down,0,127,4,4,184
umm ah back in hyperspace,0,468,7,7,149
so trying to stay within the hexagon,0,468,7,7,139
okay i didnt know that those mines could move,0,51,1,1,13
money sign left click bonus,0,681,8,8,304
alright turn turn turn turn,0,210,6,6,83
so i should stop missing,0,3,7,7,143
okay oh okay now i understand so forward is forward and im just moving left and right  if i wanna decrease the speed i actually dont know how to do that,0,468,1,1,8
alright i am at 11 and i dont think i know exactly what to do there we go,0,558,10,10,71
i guess im just not doing it fast enough,0,127,8,8,252
quails stop x rays,0,53,10,10,465
nope stop,0,14,4,4,587
and hyper drive i didnt wanna do that,0,14,4,4,589
learn how to move,0,16,8,8,672
p oh man alright im going for it,0,190,4,4,173
nope nope turn around turn there you go turn turn,0,210,3,3,35
like what im thinking is it pushes you forward really fast and um so like when it pushes you you need to change directions to slow down or else youll go flying,0,214,5,5,306
oh i am clicking too slow on the intervals with the enemy enemy mines,0,404,7,7,256
im using backspace and it doesnt go back,0,54,5,5,301
nope too fast,0,788,8,8,161
out of control still,0,319,10,10,258
turn,0,28,10,10,462
im doing good with mines and going off the screen,0,51,5,5,172
stinkin move,0,16,5,5,404
i got to slow down,0,34,7,7,334
damn these shits movin faster,0,16,5,5,424
okay left turn,0,27,1,1,10
alright no,0,28,3,3,124
how do you go forward again,0,57,8,8,1324
alright bet,0,16,5,5,429
qwk i think double right click and then kill that thing,0,52,8,8,795
well hyper space is an easy way to get away from mines but you start moving too quickly yoawe come on,0,14,6,6,648
p yeah like maybe i should try shooting some more but just wanna get the control thing first down so you like,0,468,3,3,44
alright,0,28,9,9,371
turn thrust turn thrust turn thrust,0,53,10,10,481
left,0,20,7,7,657
stop hitting me,0,29,2,2,354
tqj alright yes,0,404,4,4,136
can you slow down,0,113,8,8,494
so now we are trying to get back into the hexagon unfortunately there is a foe mine on the screen that hasnt been shot so luckily i was able to avoid it,0,848,8,8,367
alright we have to wait 250 milliseconds before each shot,0,20,5,5,566
yeah the counterclockwise thing is not working for me,0,52,7,7,767
get back on ok go slow again fix the aim,0,300,8,8,371
going out of control really wrecks your points,0,647,10,10,246
slow down,0,51,10,10,455
o thats a friendly alright,0,404,10,10,381
alright,0,29,4,4,408
im on level 10 h too fast,0,211,8,8,112
so i dont understand how when i stay still i get control points,0,54,10,10,465
p alright round two what am i going to do,0,825,1,1,44
slow down,0,51,7,7,271
nice and slow,0,41,9,9,582
still going too fast second dollar sign,0,319,7,7,183
the letter is l so im not very good at controlling this,0,3,1,1,12
ya know if i was good enough i could keep it in a circle that would be pretty cool,0,818,5,5,112
there we go and now just turn and a little bit of speed,0,51,2,2,38
terrible control score,0,41,2,2,377
the controls get out of whack very easily,0,14,1,1,456
i only wish that there was a slow down button,0,411,8,8,125
um this is very hard to control,0,739,1,1,9
wait ok i lost control,0,210,2,2,20
alright come on i got the turn game now,0,16,5,5,381
were gona go slow the joystick is going to help me,0,52,8,8,805
let me try to slow down,0,3,7,7,135
um i need to stop,0,54,6,6,366
okay gonna go a lot slower,0,24,2,2,52
i was too slow on the interval that time to get the mine,0,681,3,3,247
stay in the hexagon man,0,49,4,4,357
p at the moment it feels like my thoughts are like just how to get around how do i turn like how do i keep straight how do i um do this or do that like,0,825,1,1,23
we just have to be going at the right velocity,0,848,9,9,375
p alright,0,739,1,1,6
alrighty,0,155,1,1,138
alright you my friend,0,16,3,3,193
can you please stop it,0,29,10,10,602
slow down,0,51,7,7,233
or stop missing,0,3,7,7,139
p alright that was pretty bad,0,29,2,2,346
slow down,0,51,7,7,282
okay thats how you move,0,27,1,1,5
i want to come back into the hexagon and just stay there,0,52,1,1,516
theres a mine on the screen,0,55,4,4,689
screen wrap really takes the points out of my system so if i could just avoid screen wrap then i shouldnt be mumbles,0,404,10,10,374
going to the bottom of the hexagon fire a few shots again,0,300,9,9,387
p alright zmr are the foe mines,0,372,6,6,72
slow down,0,51,9,9,366
turn around turn around make a right for forward,0,20,6,6,615
the control is a little loose,0,210,1,1,4
alright it blacked out,0,210,1,1,13
did not react fast enough,0,12,6,6,545
oh alright i already forgot the letters,0,190,3,3,157
alright imma get it back,0,16,10,10,811
you could have told me that that probably wouldnt have made a difference if you press the two middle keys together it kinda keeps them in a rotation,0,49,4,4,367
okay please stop oh wait,0,41,4,4,436
okay trying trying to go slowly,0,24,1,1,39
i have no control of this ship,0,113,3,3,332
its not like when you get hit by the missiles and the screen starts but its like the mine hits you it freezes,0,818,6,6,133
in the hexagon in the hexagon,0,28,1,1,41
alright bonus points left missiles,0,16,1,1,4
damn every time i think i have the flight pattern down i dont,0,20,6,6,605
slow down slow down,0,53,5,5,208
okay were just gonna keep going right,0,818,9,9,223
oh alright it repeats again,0,20,2,2,459
alright i missed,0,809,2,2,42
okay im going way to fast with the speed,0,34,4,4,177
left,0,910,1,1,17
alright managed to hit the enemy got the vulnerability 1 vulnerability 2,0,404,7,7,254
p alright,0,20,1,1,384
cant seem to get it to go right,0,804,3,3,260
i keep on dying but staying inside the hexagon is really hard wow i just got second bonus,0,130,6,6,349
i need to learn how to move,0,16,8,8,654
need to turn around,0,55,9,9,954
mumbles trying to make my ship so i can move to a clockwise,0,300,9,9,388
i keep losing control,0,788,8,8,159
since the movement is so hard,0,12,5,5,520
mine is on screen it is t,0,3,4,4,69
turn around aw man,0,818,10,10,253
im worried about flying it and i cant this is a lot harder than i thought,0,55,1,1,550
and go forward,0,28,7,7,289
nope nope slow down no slow the f come on man,0,16,10,10,808
ship is going very very fast,0,804,6,6,302
so much for the counterclockwise or the clock wise,0,52,4,4,612
bonus i keep flying around that works ok,0,569,7,7,204
rotating to the right,0,300,1,1,203
alright successful,0,825,4,4,147
alright first dollar sign,0,788,8,8,154
im surprised im negative 700 points right now,0,825,1,1,18
alright onf alright i can do that,0,16,1,1,8
alright thats one,0,16,4,4,318
im not even im not even trying to avoid it im just out of control right now,0,155,6,6,238
ah gotta keep it on the screen,0,739,5,5,51
so try to stasy in the hexagon but thats really hard tot do,0,12,1,1,346
is it the same controls,0,190,2,2,126
p alright,0,848,4,4,255
3 4 5 alright 6 alright 9 okay it disappeared and got no,0,29,8,8,559
turn,0,57,1,1,851
alright so dollar sign,0,14,9,9,811
alright this joystick,0,16,1,1,23
stop it,0,113,2,2,299
alright viw,0,20,3,3,493
no dont go into hyperspace,0,29,2,2,352
focus on shooting the fortress and staying inside the hexagon right now,0,300,7,7,349
i cant get this darn thing to slow down,0,127,6,6,222
like whats going on okay i should definitely go a little more slow,0,214,2,2,225
the mines go very fast as well,0,24,1,1,24
now its really the mines cause i realized the fortress doesnt really shoot like i can easily dodge like move away from its shots umm so like the mines are doing things to me now,0,411,7,7,106
and im just going like out of the bounds,0,214,1,1,204
ok let me just get inside the control,0,404,9,9,359
alright,0,41,10,10,632
mumbles turn,0,56,5,5,55
alright come on,0,16,10,10,807
and im already moving way too fast,0,14,2,2,499
p alright,0,54,2,2,203
im kind of spinning right now,0,468,8,8,179
moving way too fast,0,3,9,9,178
switches from left hand to right hand,0,685,1,1,11
any chance i could play this with my right hand,0,818,1,1,4
alright i got a friendly mine n thats,0,404,6,6,226
slow down,0,51,6,6,197
right heres another thing that im supposed to get but i think that was the first one but im honestly not paying attention to that,0,47,1,1,7
i think my new strategy is going to juts to avid this guy and just to stay on the hexagon because thats all i can kind of do,0,52,7,7,759
im im the key is entering hyperspace and just taking points,0,41,3,3,392
stop shooting me,0,818,10,10,256
hey are these controllers ok,0,214,1,1,192
alright come on,0,16,8,8,630
but trying to gain points for velocity and points,0,848,2,2,216
no why dont you turn,0,210,7,7,94
p i keep pulling backwards on the joystick even though it doesnt work,0,50,7,7,82
im going way too fast,0,3,5,5,84
i gotta turn and boost turn boost turn boost turn boost turn boost,0,16,3,3,217
im thinking that i really have to learn to slow down and how to control my ship if i learn how to do that then that means i can definitely win this game multiple times,0,41,6,6,506
i have not been able to keep control as  i accidently shot a foe mine and it blew me up,0,848,6,6,309
getting that dollar sign right,0,647,5,5,178
mumbles out of control,0,319,4,4,105
clockwise right,0,26,2,2,14
oh out of control now,0,319,3,3,54
oh jeeze oh my god slow down,0,53,1,1,31
1 alright mumbles alright 3 on the vulnerability counter,0,372,7,7,86
it starts firing at you right when you get started,0,809,4,4,70
jkl no it was jkh right,0,977,3,3,68
alright r friendly mine got the hit,0,404,7,7,270
and ive just lost control,0,818,4,4,76
alright back lemmy get them points,0,16,3,3,203
control your speed,0,51,6,6,183
alright 25 shots,0,685,10,10,224
p alright i hit it,0,404,5,5,185
alright trying to get into a good path,0,319,3,3,50
and rotation,0,30,8,8,447
and alright,0,54,10,10,450
i have no other optimal path other than going to the right,0,818,6,6,123
i need to get in control of you,0,113,8,8,487
the biggest problem is definitely keeping this thing under control and then once you do that theres definitely better ways to capitalize on the mines but im pretty sure you can just shoot them all so i dont know,0,47,6,6,95
im just going to go like that points up screen and its going to go up continuously,0,53,8,8,378
mumbles go inside 50 36 shots left,0,26,9,9,153
ohh vulnerability is gone too fast,0,211,7,7,93
moving back inside the hexagon slowing down first,0,300,5,5,301
okay so so starting to get the controls,0,41,1,1,303
p okay alright this is a lot harder than i thought ugh,0,788,1,1,60
you geet used to everytime you respond you have to immediately move again,0,12,3,3,436
cant keep control of the ship but this is hard,0,804,2,2,252
13 shots left,0,26,5,5,81
uh theres an h on the screen mine there was also just a bonus,0,848,8,8,356
alright so,0,33,5,5,720
p alright so for this game we are going to try and stay in the circle best we can oh not the circle hexagon,0,848,3,3,232
i have one shot left,0,52,10,10,896
turn,0,210,10,10,168
turn ok,0,210,7,7,114
p opposite direction so youre like trying to continuously turn i guess,0,468,2,2,23
nice and slow thats an x mine,0,41,1,1,315
moving forward again slowing down,0,300,3,3,263
see if i stop here its gonna shoot me,0,214,6,6,328
accelerates so quickly,0,52,2,2,538
occasionally i try to use thruster to shoot thats not how it works,0,14,5,5,599
just trying to keep it on the screen,0,739,3,3,34
p alright,0,14,8,8,732
4 mumbles mumbles i can control this thing i should nope,0,26,5,5,84
uh t that didnt matter i just ran right into it,0,825,2,2,77
alright well i killed it once ive improved by 1700 points im not that bad,0,41,2,2,376
turn shoot,0,28,9,9,392
alruight right right,0,20,7,7,653
and im not on the right keys,0,57,10,10,1482
stop doing that,0,51,4,4,97
alright just just trying to stabilize,0,30,3,3,127
i just figured out how to move a little better,0,214,8,8,354
slow down,0,51,7,7,287
thrust left right,0,16,2,2,97
get back in the hexagon,0,155,8,8,272
turn shoot,0,28,3,3,123
alright im at vulnerability 6 try to alter my path a little bit,0,404,6,6,229
control control control,0,404,10,10,375
alright ok,0,190,8,8,209
out of control,0,319,5,5,131
laughs alright i got this,0,190,1,1,107
rotate slow again spin to the right very slightly a t i think that was a foe mine,0,300,2,2,229
okay nice and slow managed to get one shot on it,0,41,1,1,326
i wasnt going too fast i stayed inside the hexagon flying maybe the wrong way but mumbles umm yeah so,0,468,5,5,82
i the frictionless space,0,52,5,5,656
im just trying to get the hang of the control,0,404,4,4,165
and then the fact that backwards on the control pad doesnt do anything,0,404,2,2,64
stop,0,127,4,4,180
gonna press slowly gonna shoot diagonals,0,300,4,4,289
gotta try to develop my strategy on the go im not worried about control until that last hit i guess,0,404,5,5,203
the ship wrapped the screen wow 36 times,0,155,6,6,247
p cause it tells you when to change direction and when you change direction you change acceleration,0,214,5,5,312
so i try to stay within that velocity within the fortress i dont think i will have a problem,0,848,5,5,279
p okay umm so im just trying to control the ship right now im getting a tiny better but still not really able to go the other way but still  umm so yeah i think this will take some getting used to,0,468,2,2,19
p my score got really good really fast,0,825,6,6,201
move alright,0,910,1,1,18
alright uh,0,468,1,1,14
p im trying to go clockwise,0,50,1,1,5
p alright so lets youuu,0,28,3,3,122
all right cool,0,57,6,6,1209
okay so if its lrg stop it,0,825,3,3,89
alright now im gonna start shooting the fortress now,0,28,4,4,161
alright so yeah 2373,0,568,2,2,52
p now im going out of control,0,45,3,3,23
i cant really stop this thing,0,130,1,1,214
its a foe so now i have 1 left,0,46,7,7,514
okay so i managed to stay on the screen,0,57,6,6,1202
and hes moving faster than usual it seems like,0,20,3,3,474
and turn again,0,155,2,2,162
and it seems that sometimes he doesnt shoot me but sometimes he does like depending on where i am on the screen,0,47,10,10,145
so we move around,0,14,10,10,840
so hopefully we can get it this time and just trying to stay inside the hexagon oh no its too fast,0,130,3,3,262
also shooting the fortress to destroy it at the same time the dollar sign is on the screen,0,848,10,10,405
this game is like slowly destroying my confidence at playing games,0,411,6,6,99
alright yeah,0,214,1,1,199
okay moving toward the fortress this time move forward,0,300,1,1,205
it was slower,0,53,8,8,393
i keep going into hyperspace so that not good losing points,0,34,1,1,39
p full game mumbles rules that are written on screen,0,53,6,6,242
kinda giving up on control but maybe i can do better on velocity,0,46,9,9,580
no dont go off the screen,0,14,6,6,646
too fast too fast too fast too fast,0,14,8,8,752
im not doing very well at all right now,0,809,1,1,27
slow down,0,53,7,7,339
i dont now how to control this,0,29,5,5,482
oh my god stop killing me,0,113,5,5,398
okay go forward,0,28,5,5,220
go you got move,0,51,10,10,462
slowly,0,56,10,10,181
alright i just got killed,0,372,8,8,97
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,6,6,466
and like i cant i have a problem talking and like controlling myself like i cant even do that,0,214,4,4,281
there you go slow down,0,57,3,3,1009
right click cant kill him,0,33,10,10,913
all right,0,55,8,8,902
p i just didnt realize the ship was so sensitive that just tapping the arrow it would fly off the screen,0,190,2,2,122
i cant control it,0,33,1,1,561
i think the best thing that has worked for me is to just stay still and not thrust it forward,0,54,1,1,190
alright lets get it,0,16,3,3,250
going slow trying to get that vulnerability,0,300,8,8,374
im flying in circles a bunch,0,468,6,6,120
32 shots left continuing,0,910,4,4,108
mumbles slowing down trying to get away from that its a b so im going to shoot it,0,300,4,4,274
p alright good maybe ill get a little better,0,685,1,1,23
i dont know how to slow down,0,57,1,1,876
oops no no were gonna start flying around,0,818,5,5,92
i wish i could juts stay in the hexagon like,0,52,5,5,671
so for this one i am actually going to try a different strategy of just going straight on the screen losing points for whats it called control,0,848,2,2,215
alright well im taking a bunch of hits im going to explode in 1 more hit,0,825,6,6,182
slowing down again,0,300,5,5,307
try to go real slow,0,739,5,5,54
no thats an enemy but i pressed it too fast,0,12,5,5,517
is that a 10 its a right double click,0,647,2,2,138
p right now like my problem is when i click the other one my ship just takes off and i lose control,0,49,3,3,327
oh no is it too fast,0,34,5,5,229
okay alright got some points,0,30,2,2,105
like see it hasnt shot me even though its moving really slow around it i dont think its gonna shoot,0,214,6,6,327
i died that time right,0,211,4,4,60
because its more opportune to just hit it but then youre out of the hexagon and losing points cuz youre going so fast,0,977,2,2,62
mumbles i got 3 4 4 alright still 4,0,372,5,5,68
right now im trying to spin around and stay within the hexagon which had been proven better for me this time,0,848,7,7,337
oh youre a friend oh crap i cant slow down okay,0,113,9,9,511
only a few shots left,0,432,10,10,212
alright,0,43,6,6,172
p make the spacebar a pause button,0,56,6,6,74
i would like you to stop shooting me right now,0,569,2,2,130
starting all over pressing forward moving slower this time,0,300,1,1,200
umm just trying to control the ship right now umm definitely definitely gaining some,0,468,6,6,102
this is a really difficult thing to control,0,41,1,1,294
uh right 8,0,825,2,2,78
come here alright theres definitely no there definitely wasnt no o in that shit,0,16,10,10,774
oh too fast there we go,0,211,1,1,10
im staying somewhere within the outer limit of the hexagon,0,300,3,3,260
alright nice fire fire,0,20,2,2,426
im going too slow,0,12,6,6,556
i forget but yeah slowing down is,0,49,1,1,255
gosh this thing goes so fast,0,52,2,2,546
alright not too shabby,0,28,4,4,185
im going to stop shooting because i only have 7 shots left,0,54,6,6,355
every time i see phf im going to double right click,0,52,7,7,746
slow down,0,51,7,7,286
lemmy try to see if i can control,0,29,3,3,393
i need to turn around,0,54,5,5,328
ohhh turn turn,0,57,8,8,1343
alright just coast,0,818,4,4,72
lemmy try to get the hang of this right now,0,29,6,6,488
p alright here we go,0,47,6,6,80
oh too fast too fast,0,300,3,3,255
because im pretty sure to destroy the mines its tapping the right clicker or i forget i dont really know what exactly to call it but i am not entirely sure if its actually doing anything,0,558,6,6,44
alright i got almost there,0,404,3,3,100
p i float off so fast its not even worth getting the bonus,0,18,5,5,37
but still control is at an alltime minimum,0,558,4,4,22
learn how to move,0,16,8,8,671
velocity was better,0,46,9,9,599
alright alright alright,0,113,10,10,540
when it when it says wrapped the screen that means that i went outside the screen,0,55,8,8,924
gonna try to start controlling the ship a little bit more,0,404,4,4,137
the concept is simple but the controls are another story,0,804,2,2,255
slow slow,0,51,3,3,81
ive lost control this is when it gets bad,0,34,9,9,424
ah the ship doesnt move fast enough,0,404,4,4,140
yeah like if you just try to flow with the hexagon you should be able to stay in the bounds,0,214,5,5,296
ive watched dragon ball z this is the easiest,0,825,8,8,234
in hyperspace,0,24,1,1,29
what i didnt understand was i thought i was respawning every time i go into the screen,0,214,2,2,219
stop,0,24,1,1,40
5 alright no darn it,0,825,3,3,116
turn right,0,57,3,3,1019
6 7 8 i think its not right,0,29,4,4,424
oop the screen went black,0,411,1,1,14
alrighty that was my best one yet and its over thats how it should be,0,41,5,5,469
very fast,0,848,1,1,195
slow down,0,51,6,6,215
uh slow down but that doesnt work,0,52,6,6,725
so if you do this you wrap the screen a bunch but you move so fast the fortress cant get to you until a mine comes,0,977,7,7,99
but im oh its much faster than i thought originally so slow down,0,848,1,1,194
um slow slow hey,0,53,4,4,166
definitely try tookay already going counterclockwise,0,468,8,8,188
oh no turn and then thrust turn and then thrust,0,53,10,10,475
alright come on,0,16,5,5,384
p no the ship if its on the right path i just have to focus on shooting and changing directions,0,432,9,9,194
try to stay in the hexagon,0,28,3,3,131
still going too fast,0,319,5,5,125
my ship wrapped around the screen 45 times,0,658,1,1,19
slow slow and steady wins the race,0,30,3,3,142
alright,0,28,10,10,435
i guess its just a little frustrating trying to navigate something like as you say its in hyperspace and thats just im just not used to that,0,127,2,2,161
once you have it under control its not that difficult,0,432,2,2,117
alright i just got bullets because i dont want to have to worry about that so im at 100 now get out of the way zach come on,0,685,5,5,102
im getting the control down a lot more right as i say that i kind of get out of control there,0,404,9,9,353
oh its fast,0,217,1,1,33
p points control velocity speed,0,54,10,10,448
trying to fix my trajectory in a clockwise again,0,300,8,8,368
proabbly i stayed still too often to slow down,0,12,8,8,640
i think the hardest part for me is the controlling and also the mines,0,47,7,7,110
i can go forward,0,28,6,6,255
thats the hardest part honestly im just trying to control the thing umm and not go into warp speed gonna try to shoot a little bit,0,404,2,2,61
they say the best strategy is to stay inside the hexagon but thats really hard to do,0,685,6,6,133
well the mines move really fairly slow enough to react if youre not flying into hyperspace,0,12,2,2,399
just entered hyperspace,0,41,1,1,333
p just space button,0,404,1,1,46
stop spinning whats up with the spinning,0,210,4,4,41
alright come on,0,51,4,4,112
rotate rotate,0,30,6,6,293
alright i see what imma do,0,16,10,10,784
okay slow down,0,51,8,8,334
moving slow just focusing on shooting,0,300,10,10,408
im moving a little too fast here,0,14,9,9,821
i have no control whatsoever,0,804,6,6,304
im not even worrying about the mines right now because im still trying to get the hang of the controls so im just focusing on killing fortress so once i get that down i can start to work on the mines,0,681,1,1,212
alright so for this one im gonna try to take it nice and slow and stay in the hexagon and try to not get shot and whenever mines come uh try and deal with them as quickly as possible,0,848,4,4,258
alright so mouse left mouse center,0,54,5,5,285
p alright,0,804,10,10,397
p slower slow,0,50,4,4,38
nope slow down slow down,0,14,7,7,721
but i can turn it that into a friendly uh yeah,0,52,3,3,574
always starts right away,0,46,5,5,443
and come back all right im good,0,57,1,1,845
get going clockwise,0,46,1,1,363
got it right in the kisser,0,41,4,4,441
alright so how will i try this game,0,848,9,9,373
alright this is a good strategy for me here i might not get a lot of points but i might actually,0,404,7,7,266
gotta slow down this ship man,0,49,4,4,363
i cant even slow this down,0,51,1,1,10
now turn this way,0,51,9,9,346
f alright just gonna let it hit me,0,681,2,2,237
turn around,0,54,4,4,272
i dont know what im clicking right now,0,155,1,1,148
like i dont know some people cut their steak with their right hand and then they switch hands to like scoop rice or whatever,0,53,4,4,159
at this point i just have to slowly drift off and not get shot at,0,411,8,8,126
alright trying to get into a good path,0,319,2,2,42
stop going off the screen,0,29,9,9,590
once you like once i like lose control i like cant get it back,0,43,5,5,162
i have 69 shots left so plenty,0,848,3,3,244
wont turn around pressed it once,0,55,2,2,588
alright,0,16,4,4,286
not the right interval messed up going too fast,0,319,6,6,161
moving too fast moving too fast,0,14,1,1,448
its really difficult to control this like i know it looks not hard,0,41,2,2,372
now we are trying to stay on the right side because there is some problem with the fortresss right side apparently,0,848,6,6,311
turn,0,51,5,5,160
okay so lets slow down slow down,0,34,9,9,423
my intervals are too fast i should slow down,0,130,6,6,341
i forget theres no slowing down and the thing is if you forget the letters your whole game will be off so,0,49,5,5,373
1528 uninterpretable alright get him out of here,0,16,4,4,333
alrighty cant shoot it too fast,0,14,2,2,500
ah mumbles got out of control about to get nailed by the fortress shot,0,404,6,6,233
its at one time right now oh it ok,0,20,2,2,460
p but you have to be inside the control zone,0,404,8,8,284
the interval is 2 right now ah theres a mine its a friendly mine so its ok,0,404,3,3,89
alright so thats one of them,0,33,6,6,753
there alright thats one,0,16,4,4,309
i ran right into it because these controls are really difficult,0,41,8,8,557
okay too fast,0,14,9,9,802
move that closer a bit,0,52,8,8,784
youll probably have to hit spacebar again,0,3,1,1,6
p counterclockwise,0,26,2,2,12
going to try to go clockwise,0,300,6,6,329
i realize that during the end of the last game i was only single clicking the right i dont really know what to call it the right mouse thing instead of double clicking it to destroy the foe mines i guess you could say,0,558,4,4,21
im liking this slow speed thing,0,647,3,3,153
ill just sit at the edge here i guess,0,14,2,2,482
turn turn turn turn turn,0,56,6,6,76
i can just shoot it right now,0,33,3,3,638
once i have the ship flying on autopilot in my head i will get better at the game,0,681,1,1,213
i can also feel the snap back if you dont position the joystick back to neutral like a game controller,0,468,3,3,38
its hard to control,0,454,1,1,151
alright im just going to do this,0,113,3,3,317
wrong count on that one i can get it right,0,432,10,10,209
okay turn around and got his way,0,56,8,8,114
just tapping to slow myself down,0,300,1,1,213
its really hard to kill this fortress oh no i left it too early ill get the bonus next time,0,130,10,10,429
okay well i cant get the interval right now but there we go,0,34,8,8,391
didnt get the chance to see rotating the wrong way,0,14,5,5,625
oops too fast and thats e which is not an enemy so umm ok damn it,0,848,1,1,207
so i was not on the right part of the keyboard,0,57,8,8,1323
oh man that was right,0,30,9,9,484
slow down,0,12,3,3,446
alright,0,16,8,8,613
q which is an unfriendly mine ok i just gotta hit it at the right interval,0,404,5,5,184
i got get back into this green hexagon,0,54,1,1,186
umm if i dont move fast enough then the fortress will shoot me,0,404,1,1,41
stick and move stick and move,0,16,3,3,213
p rzl for any and all ending in r oh iots so fast,0,12,1,1,343
p alright cool,0,848,2,2,214
set moving counterclockwise bwe thats a friendly shoot that one,0,910,1,1,15
but like if you keep moving like that you know,0,214,6,6,325
p ird ird alright ird free shot thats annoying there you go,0,41,5,5,446
maybe ill go faster now,0,432,7,7,159
alright,0,51,7,7,285
im enjoying the fact that at least my spaceship goes like an actual airplane  its delightful to see,0,804,5,5,282
controlling 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 awe come on im one more shot,0,41,4,4,417
this is going way too fast,0,739,1,1,10
too bad i keep losing points because i keep going into hyperspace,0,804,7,7,340
but i cant really stay inside the hexagon,0,130,2,2,256
no hyperspace,0,818,6,6,145
alright no okay turn turn this,0,113,2,2,281
trying to stay still aw no thats a bonus nice but last game i kinda shot whenever i wasnt moving too much so staying in control could be the priority since it doesnt really shoot all the time,0,130,9,9,398
p yeah i was ship damaged 20 times by the fortress 8 times by mines destroyed 0 fortress i wrapped the screen 47 times,0,568,1,1,28
alright,0,558,4,4,28
p wow its really fast,0,217,1,1,34
speed 100 velocity 250,0,34,6,6,319
managed to stay in the control zone a lot more,0,404,9,9,336
no overturned it,0,28,5,5,227
okay go forward,0,51,5,5,157
oh man  oh oh my god its really fast,0,130,1,1,213
well were doing good in points right now which is good,0,34,9,9,415
uh its getting out the screen,0,739,10,10,104
this motherworder going fast,0,16,6,6,492
time my shots so theyre between the right millisecond intervals so it doesnt reset,0,681,1,1,199
so its not that much of a mumble and like the mine changes soon like im not worried about the mines either itll move fast enough,0,214,6,6,329
left,0,51,10,10,431
l that needs to be turned oh,0,52,5,5,692
nope im mustve did something right that time,0,20,10,10,801
p well just stop after 10,0,681,5,5,265
in the hexagon,0,28,1,1,43
i got a 9 right now,0,818,7,7,182
alright jyq,0,16,5,5,347
alright thats an e,0,16,7,7,534
ship wrapped around the screen eight times,0,55,7,7,853
alright its a mine,0,24,1,1,23
alright lets try ti get the 10 shot,0,910,4,4,102
every time i fly through so now we can keep doing this and it will remain in the high 400s until we destroy the fortress,0,848,9,9,386
cant control my speed so,0,910,5,5,125
striping across the screen is working for me,0,46,7,7,511
straight left i didnt even look ok,0,20,7,7,674
i have to turn it into a,0,52,2,2,536
apparently shooting it does not work so im gonna have to stop doing that,0,804,10,10,411
alright,0,28,1,1,64
im moving really fast,0,3,2,2,40
fast fast go around,0,210,4,4,45
alright,0,28,4,4,166
p alright thats fine i think its not in between,0,40,5,5,94
slow down,0,51,4,4,114
okay im just going to try and go faster,0,34,3,3,135
p supposed to stay inside this hexagon,0,50,3,3,28
stop coming this way,0,43,5,5,165
and alright,0,30,3,3,112
alright here we go,0,28,1,1,53
let myself fly across,0,20,8,8,690
moving around again gotta speed up,0,300,2,2,234
alright come on come here,0,16,8,8,645
okay were at 3 right now which is nice,0,34,4,4,199
alright my score went down again thats always promising,0,558,5,5,39
p its hard to stay inside of hyperspace,0,454,4,4,195
oh my got its getting faster,0,211,3,3,43
im going backwards,0,468,4,4,52
responding kinda slowly to the mines,0,46,3,3,402
i keep getting pushed out the screen,0,454,3,3,182
i see why they call it hyperspace,0,214,9,9,370
im slowly moving through,0,300,4,4,290
this round i am going to try a new strategy of flying back and forth on the same side,0,848,5,5,277
phf double right click,0,52,7,7,751
and slow down,0,28,7,7,315
alright im only going to shoot why i know thats a friend so bang bang,0,20,10,10,803
p alright next step,0,49,8,8,435
alright things are a little faster than i may have thought they would,0,28,1,1,22
i cant remember i think i have to  if its tba i have to turn it into a,0,52,6,6,739
slow it down,0,28,5,5,207
wowowow a lot stickier than i thought left and right dont correspond,0,977,1,1,50
spaceship doesnt stop at all which doesnt help at all,0,804,1,1,243
one im drifting off into space,0,41,2,2,371
just completely lost control may have died,0,818,2,2,31
turn and go,0,28,7,7,313
alright oh i got 12 i got 12,0,113,4,4,359
its kind of off balance to control,0,210,1,1,9
umm oh so you just bounce off the middle very interesting i wonder if that can be used strategically to stop yourself,0,468,7,7,148
i cant hit the fortress but i have one shot left come on,0,685,7,7,149
p alright closer to zero,0,16,3,3,255
too fast now,0,46,1,1,360
and then i really wish you could slow down any other way,0,12,2,2,405
ive gone into hyperspace like 5 times,0,40,3,3,72
umm its hard to control,0,372,1,1,4
p its kind of hard to control the iff its friendly so,0,50,1,1,7
slow down,0,51,7,7,254
i need to slow down,0,53,4,4,192
like hey yea i got this and actually like flies circles around and actually like defeats it,0,53,4,4,171
im really trying to figure out how to slow down here i know its the opposite direction counterintuitive,0,41,6,6,498
alright,0,26,1,1,5
oh thats an enemy theres a bonus get back on the control 539,0,130,10,10,428
slow slow ah of course,0,53,4,4,164
keep going to the right no dont go into hyperspace,0,818,7,7,180
i guess one of the things that i dont like is that it requires you to move in a pattern instead of just being able to fly around like you dont lose points if you fly around at least then you arent like more,0,411,9,9,136
no we just lost control again,0,818,8,8,212
alright cool,0,53,4,4,145
alright were gonna go out this way we can shoot now go straight clockwise he does not shoot you went youre going fast,0,818,1,1,12
umm t nope that was too fast,0,404,7,7,251
mumbles see im out of control now,0,404,4,4,163
p i gotta use my left hand,0,16,4,4,261
alright,0,28,9,9,381
slowly,0,28,4,4,173
i bet i know how to move,0,16,1,1,48
all right,0,55,5,5,749
stop hitting the center,0,51,9,9,369
stop on the screen and stop it,0,51,8,8,323
slow the fword okay,0,16,8,8,617
i think i have 1 or 2 lives left,0,46,7,7,513
p i still have 2 games left to play 3,0,685,8,8,163
i just tried to right click for shoot i dont know why,0,14,7,7,717
i press the keys too fast,0,12,5,5,505
oh shit dont go off screen,0,131,2,2,36
theres 1 dollar sign and now the second very hard to control and i,0,848,1,1,209
p it seems like you get more points going in circles than shooting it,0,18,8,8,43
going slow so far not pressing the forward so much just going to loop around again,0,300,8,8,365
once you go a little too fast its almost impossible,0,12,10,10,678
or too fast,0,34,1,1,44
alright so im just going to keep shooting and pray something happens,0,113,3,3,333
slow down,0,51,10,10,402
im getting better at identifying the foes and double clicking the correct time interval and i just took the points and i shouldve took the shots because i only have 3 left,0,685,9,9,197
slow interval,0,28,10,10,450
why cant i circle this shit,0,16,3,3,215
going off screen you need to control your speed,0,51,6,6,178
oh that was too fast,0,568,2,2,41
oh if i can rotate i can kill that,0,52,4,4,616
okay so i should probably start moving since that two of the four things that i get my points from,0,54,10,10,449
slow interval and shoot,0,28,10,10,445
okay thats 1 down probably the fastest ill ever do it 1 got the missile 2 3 4 almost 5 you are t you are nothing important,0,825,6,6,190
percent sign not really worried about the bonus right now i have 52 shots,0,41,2,2,356
alright,0,825,2,2,51
god he never stops moving,0,20,2,2,431
going slow making passes,0,300,8,8,370
forward,0,51,8,8,339
alright what is this next one at,0,16,2,2,143
trying to get control is that its hard,0,432,7,7,163
alright come on,0,16,9,9,701
alright so points,0,54,4,4,275
going extremely fast in this game,0,34,1,1,17
press the 4 button for a few times so i can control my speed,0,300,7,7,342
i cant control it,0,788,8,8,156
alright this is the last game i gotta do a lot better than ive been doing,0,685,10,10,213
okay im starting to get in a rhythm of moving around and shooting this thing,0,681,4,4,254
p ah alright,0,20,2,2,421
got 2 right away,0,46,6,6,466
slow down,0,51,6,6,216
gosh youre still out of space,0,214,2,2,217
this is hard to move around,0,54,8,8,410
alright well,0,14,5,5,597
this would be a lot easier i did not expect that to move like that,0,27,1,1,11
alright two shots,0,473,5,5,268
alright so this time we are still trying to stay within the fortress,0,848,6,6,326
ah knew that was gonna happen i was right that was friendly didnt have time to look at the iff there either,0,404,9,9,354
when it starts going too fast thats when it gets dangerous,0,34,7,7,333
phf double right click so hes friendly,0,52,7,7,760
i just shot the fortress twice too fast so i dont want the vulnerability to set back to 0 from 3,0,848,5,5,293
ah man going out of control here ok bonus if that pops up again im gonna hit it,0,404,10,10,377
forget trying to stay in the stupid hexagon,0,14,3,3,541
im already going way to fast,0,52,3,3,561
alright,0,16,3,3,229
stay out of the bounds,0,47,10,10,136
too fast too fast,0,56,4,4,49
im going to press the spacebar,0,20,1,1,385
alright,0,28,5,5,211
ugh right back to zero,0,52,7,7,773
i am at 478 right now only 61 shots left,0,372,3,3,41
p um alright,0,3,1,1,3
its just so hard to keep up with everything at the bottom because it changes so much the game just moves so quickly,0,211,9,9,129
yes only wrapped around the screen eight times and missed two bonuses,0,55,6,6,797
i hit the iff button and i just like guess if im doing it right,0,40,3,3,63
trying to regain control,0,319,5,5,121
stay on the screen,0,739,7,7,74
alright there we go,0,51,2,2,25
p thrust would be 8 clockwise that would be 4 clockwise is right joystick top button which is enter,0,52,3,3,558
keep going into hyperspace,0,804,5,5,287
alright,0,51,4,4,123
slow down,0,51,6,6,201
i gotta remember to move immediately,0,404,5,5,200
trying to stay inside that hexagon,0,300,3,3,249
got the mine alright just keep this speed nope nope nope ill get the hang of this in a couple of more games,0,818,4,4,67
dollar signs popped up one time enemy mine going out of control,0,319,4,4,106
i lost control,0,788,9,9,173
im just going to go out of bounds until you leave me alone,0,113,3,3,319
get that control,0,130,10,10,415
p alrighty so control screen fio,0,41,2,2,341
qwk qwk cutebly k i have it turn it into a friendly mien but i dont know where im clicking,0,52,8,8,786
okay slow down and aim and fire,0,28,4,4,178
okay thats just keep going to the right hyperspaceit,0,818,8,8,206
i got a lot of points for staying in the circle,0,12,10,10,692
alright bvd,0,28,10,10,454
slow down slow down slow down,0,28,10,10,410
right when i get to the end it kills me,0,404,7,7,277
so theres kind of no thinking going on im just trying to control the thing,0,818,1,1,10
p alright,0,910,1,1,22
so i can slow down,0,214,4,4,277
already going too fast,0,52,4,4,610
but the turns cause they move in the hexagon so like they can get you,0,214,6,6,330
slow down,0,51,7,7,257
im trying to control in this and im having a very hard time,0,20,1,1,390
okay they turned up the difficulty,0,41,7,7,512
is that two yep let me get those yeah right back,0,16,6,6,451
p ok alright,0,404,5,5,206
no no stop exiting the screen,0,113,2,2,282
p mouse left,0,51,5,5,126
fresh start how does it make it slow one time,0,52,9,9,839
alright where that shit at,0,16,5,5,362
going a little too fast i gotta compensate,0,681,2,2,228
loosing control,0,818,9,9,233
all right come back,0,57,7,7,1273
mumbling letters at beginning screen oqi oqi,0,404,5,5,176
15 shots left,0,26,10,10,172
there it is trying to stay inside the arena whatever it is in outer space,0,569,5,5,174
it turned me completely around no i didnt want to go that way,0,818,8,8,198
alright,0,825,3,3,98
unintelligible im getting bonus points because im not going into hyperspace that much,0,804,6,6,297
and there is 10 so right now we need 2 within 250 i believe,0,848,3,3,245
pu and f well hyperspace is going to help me get a away,0,34,10,10,456
hyperspace,0,28,4,4,176
its frustrating i have to play with my left hand,0,658,6,6,54
theres a foe on the screen and is a,0,46,7,7,512
alright got up to 7 that time,0,558,6,6,50
what i did in one of the other games which was sacrifice control for points and speed,0,848,9,9,374
and then umm oh no i shot too fast no,0,130,2,2,251
just blew up again just trying to stay within the fortress this time the speed is very fast,0,848,1,1,200
slow down,0,12,2,2,410
oops mumbles alright,0,319,2,2,43
alright,0,26,4,4,46
turn turn then go straight,0,28,2,2,75
p so i guess try to go as slowly as possible,0,432,2,2,112
so you always wanna be moving,0,468,9,9,205
slow down,0,28,6,6,258
i wasnt expecting to be using my left hand um cause im a righthanded person,0,53,1,1,11
need to slow down,0,28,8,8,343
you just have to slow down mumbles really fast,0,190,1,1,116
turn trying to get into a good path trying to get some shots down friendly mine approaching,0,319,2,2,37
im shooting the base as i move across from it and rotating and shooting at the same time,0,300,9,9,401
yea thats right,0,53,7,7,295
your ship wrapped the screen 34 times,0,54,7,7,405
stop,0,49,8,8,444
it keeps stuttering a little bit sometimes which doesnt affect the play all that much but is kind of jarring when youre moving really fast and then you hit a mine and then the whole screen freezes,0,818,6,6,132
yes alright,0,51,5,5,171
p alright lets do this,0,568,3,3,60
if i could even control it at all,0,404,1,1,40
its really hard to control this guy,0,47,2,2,21
move slowly,0,14,1,1,454
were gonna keep going to the right,0,818,8,8,202
the most important part is going slow,0,432,5,5,143
seems if i get too slow i get killed by the center immediately so i have to maintain some velocity,0,681,3,3,242
p thats something right,0,432,1,1,100
so im getting the hang of it now not just the hang of moving,0,214,7,7,333
now if i kind of go around the edge of the screen its a lot easier and a lot more time umm im still worried about points,0,404,5,5,186
so most of my points are control cause this ship only shoots one way,0,130,9,9,397
3 4 come on zach alright im going a little fast,0,685,8,8,171
mumbles okay so that im always facing the hexagon,0,57,7,7,1257
your ship wrapped the screen 42 times,0,53,6,6,289
this round has been a lot easier with control unfortunately speed is still a problem i havent been able to find the right speed that the game prefers to add points,0,848,5,5,281
5 vulnerability 6 try to shoot it about once every time i wrap the screen,0,404,7,7,269
slowly shooting it not really paying attention to mumbles from the hexagon,0,300,10,10,422
alright one dollar sign waiting for the next,0,20,4,4,539
turn turn turn,0,127,8,8,260
dang man i be movin too fast for me to shoot this thing,0,16,3,3,220
its not hitting the space station,0,804,8,8,360
ah no trying to stay inside the hexagon,0,468,5,5,78
y okay thats a foe alright,0,473,1,1,169
my control is going up,0,54,5,5,324
ok so i feel like im just turning the ship and i dont know how to actually um like move it forward,0,468,1,1,7
well try to move around more often,0,54,10,10,451
alright that motherfworder coming for me,0,16,10,10,756
bo and e so i have to right click then kill that,0,52,10,10,867
holding down the clockwise thing makes me go slower,0,52,3,3,577
but at least i can stay within the hexagon a little better,0,57,7,7,1309
no no no turn,0,818,9,9,232
got it oh man this is the second part of the hyperspace yep got it,0,818,4,4,77
dang i just dont be moving way quick enough,0,16,4,4,290
oh fly this way,0,20,5,5,569
trying to control the ship first,0,300,1,1,214
velocity is a little too high,0,848,9,9,381
i must have went too fast or didnt react fast enough,0,12,9,9,653
alright my dog ej,0,16,3,3,187
literally flight path is impossible maybe itll be easier with joystick,0,20,4,4,534
im just gonna oh i can alright,0,28,5,5,222
oh i tried to slow down by pressing the stick backwards,0,411,6,6,91
slow down,0,51,6,6,195
come on slow down,0,127,10,10,285
just gonna keep going to the right same thing ive been doing trying not to fail taking out the mines doing pretty bad pretty bad,0,818,9,9,237
the hardest part i think as well is not wrapping around the screen because it makes it easier but you lose points by doing that,0,685,2,2,41
how fast they want it,0,16,9,9,743
oh crap just fly away fly away oh no,0,113,9,9,514
ah come on i had 2 shots left to kill it and i died thats not cool,0,685,8,8,166
its got 2 right away from the fortress,0,46,5,5,461
alright h,0,16,3,3,192
alright 4 probably gonna screen wrap 100 times here,0,404,7,7,260
okay going too fast,0,12,4,4,495
stop hitting the thing,0,24,6,6,129
ill get some bonus right now nice,0,20,2,2,461
slower slower,0,56,1,1,7
oh its so hard to focus on the bonus and control the ship,0,214,2,2,234
the mines i completely forgot about them ive been trying to just get the controls down,0,658,2,2,25
oh losing control here,0,788,9,9,178
still in hyperspace looking at all these planets,0,57,3,3,988
alright thats the second one down,0,825,6,6,193
three on the vulnerability counter i bounced off the octagon and the game is over,0,41,2,2,375
p kyx no stop stop flying,0,210,4,4,39
slow down again slow down slow down that one mine really kinda messed me up here,0,41,5,5,457
move a little forward a little bit,0,28,1,1,32
alright a youre friendly and youre gone,0,825,6,6,187
okay i see how i gotta move,0,16,2,2,131
alright and one two oh i missed and died before it,0,825,5,5,172
alright aim and fire thats 6 starting to get better at this,0,825,2,2,70
lose control of the ship,0,432,3,3,124
p ah jeez slow down slow down,0,50,5,5,52
thats not the alright,0,28,1,1,50
unfortunately i did not click right trigger twice fast enough,0,848,4,4,262
and theres a dime whatever slow down slow down,0,569,5,5,179
stop,0,411,6,6,93
so fast,0,647,10,10,245
im just going to stay right here and start shooting him,0,113,1,1,266
oh thats right ok,0,211,4,4,59
make a left,0,20,7,7,651
i think i hot too fast,0,12,1,1,359
i dotn always go so slow,0,52,1,1,519
uh thats friendly but i cannot slow down enough to shoot it,0,3,5,5,80
okay were at 5 right now,0,34,5,5,241
i slowed too soon,0,29,4,4,427
getting it under control is the hardest thing,0,211,2,2,32
alright slow down,0,16,4,4,305
moving too fast,0,12,4,4,479
move forward,0,28,2,2,79
cant waste this turn man i gotta learn how to move,0,16,8,8,676
oh because i need to back into the hexagon,0,54,5,5,325
turn turn turn,0,127,10,10,290
woah this is so hard to control,0,51,1,1,6
straight right straight right straight left left left left,0,20,7,7,660
slow down and turn and move,0,28,10,10,428
slow down,0,53,3,3,119
gotta slow down,0,41,6,6,492
rotating at a 90 degree angle,0,300,5,5,305
its a lot faster than i wanted,0,788,1,1,61
so i need to click faster next time between the 2,0,468,6,6,124
for some reason velocity very very bad,0,29,5,5,481
moving a little bit too fast,0,14,5,5,605
i think thats always important in a game you gotta learn how to move first,0,214,8,8,353
stop shooting me,0,54,9,9,438
im slowly moving strait towards the fortress and now im dead,0,14,5,5,608
i wish i ciuld get it slower,0,52,9,9,820
have to stay ok i gotta go slow thats my problem im going to fast,0,52,1,1,497
going too fast,0,319,9,9,223
no slow down,0,28,3,3,137
then were gonna go back into this hexagon,0,54,8,8,421
alright i got it going here im at 5,0,848,2,2,219
p the only thing is wrapping the screen i just cant really avoid it its one or the other if i cant control it then,0,404,4,4,122
so i move so quickly though,0,57,10,10,1491
i should really stop starting to turn to try and get a cheap shot because im not going to turn fast enough to get a cheap shot,0,825,4,4,135
your ship wrapped the screen twentyfive times,0,57,9,9,1448
i can like just mmm mumbles alright stop moving,0,568,2,2,49
all right all right,0,57,2,2,948
alright i got my strategy,0,33,5,5,731
i think the best strategy ive figured out is just let it thrust one way and then just float and try not to get hit while you shoot the fortress,0,685,2,2,34
p i went to hyper space,0,55,8,8,925
theres a lot of divided attention going on its pretty intense and i cannot stay in this hexagon,0,190,2,2,133
really slowed down,0,41,4,4,442
26 shots left,0,26,3,3,31
too fast too fast too fast,0,14,2,2,484
alright percent cant use that,0,454,5,5,199
hopefully itll offset some of the 1000 because im flying in circles,0,468,4,4,59
p slow down slow down,0,50,4,4,48
come on turn and shoot turn and shoot turn and shoot,0,16,8,8,643
gonna get back inside gotta get back inside the hexagon,0,300,1,1,204
okay so right now friend okay,0,34,1,1,22
once it starts going fast its really hard to,0,404,10,10,380
trying to go clockwise,0,647,1,1,125
im getting my timing right in between the shots so the counter doesnt reset,0,681,4,4,260
that was off real off oops back to the optimal method of losing control of my ship,0,818,5,5,83
turn,0,56,1,1,12
p im doing better at staying in the hexagon well i was doing better at staying in the hexagon,0,45,7,7,76
okay gonna see if i can start rotating again and avoid that mine,0,300,2,2,233
you know i think im playing under the assumption that i cant go counterclockwise yeah that i have to go clockwise,0,214,7,7,339
aright shot,0,16,3,3,189
alright i think i did better this time around,0,568,2,2,50
i dont know if that was friendly or not i gotta watch the bottom to try to control the thing,0,113,1,1,255
p the foe mines are phf that means i have to if its a foe i have to turn it into a friendly mine in order to kill it so if its phf i have to double right click phf double right click,0,52,7,7,743
alright,0,16,2,2,172
get my moving down get my moving down,0,16,1,1,67
alright,0,127,1,1,129
i am going way to fast and it is tough right now,0,34,1,1,46
controlling the spaceship is the hardest thing here,0,28,1,1,51
how are you supposed to go in a circle and shoot,0,739,7,7,73
im really just going for control almost,0,404,5,5,187
alright yeah thats one dollar sign that ive seen at least,0,33,3,3,669
p okay i keep losing control almost immediately and i am having a lot of trouble slowing down,0,558,4,4,19
i have lost track of the money right now,0,34,2,2,88
all right,0,55,5,5,739
now im flying too fast,0,3,8,8,165
i am trying to slow down,0,53,9,9,427
well i got the interval right but i could not hit it,0,804,10,10,408
that was evenly faster,0,12,9,9,661
going back to the hexagon,0,300,6,6,330
slow down slow down,0,127,10,10,284
slow down,0,131,2,2,46
right now i have 1000 which i think is just fantastic,0,558,1,1,5
im going a bit slower,0,300,1,1,212
okay hit thei have terrible movement,0,468,9,9,202
alrighty,0,647,1,1,113
alright just a bonus once dollar sign pops up again got it alright points bonus,0,404,9,9,357
alright im getting a little bit better,0,190,1,1,110
i gotta get my muscle memory down as soon as i seen it to get the interval right,0,681,3,3,244
i always hate this  all right that didnt work,0,804,5,5,283
i have to learn to fly this thing before i can get the other functions down because its so difficult like those missiles,0,127,9,9,265
alright get out the way,0,16,4,4,325
okay so doing good on velocity,0,34,9,9,434
rotate rotating to aim,0,300,8,8,380
stop,0,43,10,10,199
alright so that was wow,0,113,3,3,328
ah alright so if i boom boom boom,0,20,4,4,517
i fly so okay there you go,0,214,4,4,278
im going to preserve my bullets and try to at least alright i got more bullets so im good for a little bit,0,685,4,4,90
no no stop,0,818,8,8,194
im controlling it,0,818,10,10,272
slow down,0,51,8,8,314
slow down slow down,0,28,1,1,24
turn and thrust turn and thrust,0,53,10,10,479
okay not doing too hot on this one on velocity or anything either,0,34,10,10,477
p ugh i shot it too fast because of the mine,0,400,9,9,134
going too slow,0,319,8,8,197
shot way to fast couldve gotten it,0,34,4,4,212
wsg alright so friend,0,473,2,2,181
do i just press spacebar to continue,0,30,1,1,53
my intervals are too fast for the mine however its vulnerability is getting higher im going really fast,0,130,10,10,421
out of control,0,319,5,5,126
yeah i think i forfeited staying in that um hexagon so now its just a game all about timing and accuracy to hopefully destroy one of these,0,825,4,4,137
p oh ok alright,0,404,7,7,274
okay screen just went black,0,34,1,1,50
im trying to slow this spaceship down cuz its going too fast,0,130,2,2,246
there okay now i can move,0,16,2,2,135
all right i dont even know how to memorize that,0,57,9,9,1389
okay now im movin way too fast,0,16,2,2,168
w ok managed to hit that enemy ok this is kind of just the grind right here,0,404,7,7,267
mumbles going too fast,0,319,3,3,58
mumbles clockwise mumbles alright,0,26,7,7,114
i just turned my friend into a foe,0,49,4,4,369
this thing move quick,0,16,1,1,14
points control,0,54,7,7,399
i think i clicked too fast,0,130,2,2,249
turn toward,0,28,7,7,290
turn the direction if i go the other way,0,52,2,2,550
alright do i just go on to the next one,0,51,1,1,20
alright my aim is terrible,0,190,2,2,132
you just can like go in a circle,0,51,4,4,107
alright,0,28,8,8,347
i was so close to shooting it i had 10 vulnerability so just trying to circle around clockwise oh no i couldve killed it twice,0,130,8,8,394
alright that is a c so that is a friendly,0,910,2,2,42
alright,0,28,4,4,177

and im out of control,0,28,8,8,341
i just walked right into that one,0,155,7,7,262
getting used to the sensitivity but i completely expect that once the controls change it will be difficult all over again,0,12,3,3,451
um just getting a lot more control of my ship,0,404,4,4,143
see if i just screen wrap and kind of just stay in one horizontal err vertical line then that actually works pretty well for me,0,404,7,7,248
too fast,0,24,1,1,32
i think im getting worse because because its im not focusing staying in the bounds,0,57,4,4,1073

okay so move this thing here,0,57,8,8,1330
alright,0,54,5,5,337
not many people unintelligible feel like my biggest issue is controlling the ship since the ship doesnt stop at all,0,804,5,5,291

still trying to gain control its a really difficult game you werent kidding 4 thats a friendly mine,0,41,2,2,368
slow down,0,127,6,6,224
its much harder to dodge the missiles when youre inside the hexagon,0,400,3,3,70

i thought i was getting good at flying,0,20,3,3,497
p ok i cant seem to control myself,0,809,1,1,16
your ship warped through the screen 29 times,0,825,1,1,42

alright,0,28,4,4,170

so im supposed to point at them and hit the right mouse button,0,658,2,2,27

its very instinctual to press the key as fast as you can and thats not what youre supposed to do,0,12,4,4,498
i wrote the flight path that i wanted to do but this is not working,0,20,1,1,410
9 i got 1 more then i gotta start going for the control shot,0,404,7,7,263
