oh that was a fast one,0,20,7,7,683
go right go straight,0,20,6,6,603
no dont lose control yet,0,685,4,4,85
okay alright were gonna go the optimal path now,0,818,3,3,43
alright imma just work like this,0,16,3,3,233
wow okay thats i think i have one more hit left,0,34,6,6,285
slow down,0,28,2,2,105
once i learn how to turn i swear ill get the game right,0,16,4,4,275
p oh alright,0,404,1,1,18
slow down,0,131,1,1,29
alright,0,28,7,7,284
alright now im at vulnerability 4 mumbling,0,404,6,6,218
too fast,0,788,2,2,80
ah ok i see alright,0,214,1,1,189
umm the whole counterclockwise trying to move in the control zone is really iffy for me,0,404,8,8,319
i need it to go slower i need it to calm down,0,52,8,8,801
p alright that was really frustrating because it kind of got stuck in an endless loop in between both sides,0,558,3,3,15
thats 12 and i mumbles alright,0,788,8,8,160
ohhh right on time,0,53,9,9,443
not staying inside the hexagon now i am,0,569,8,8,221
turn,0,51,5,5,158
13 shots left,0,26,9,9,159
im going to try shooting at a slower rate this time,0,300,4,4,285
mumbles out go back in mumbles move or stay inside okay,0,26,8,8,125
yeah the way that the hexagon changes its like um its perfect,0,214,5,5,303
haha i think my ultimate strategy here is to really not even worry about the control zone because it is so hard to stay in,0,404,2,2,78
oh ive gotten to slow down officially now,0,113,8,8,488
too fast,0,40,3,3,69
so just constantly moving,0,400,1,1,48
turn go forward go forward there you go forward turn,0,210,5,5,55
for this game we are going to try and do originally what the goal of the game is to fly in a hexagon around the fortress periodically shooting it for some reason it has not shot at me yet,0,848,7,7,331
and i have it right within what i need,0,34,4,4,166
pokay mouse right,0,55,1,1,539
for some reason the fortress seems to like its shots are easily predictable and it only shoots when youre at a certain velocity and distance from the fortress,0,848,5,5,278
going in a circle is another thing,0,468,6,6,115
all right so try to move,0,12,1,1,350
p turn ok,0,210,4,4,48
stop on screen,0,51,8,8,316
but if my theory still proves true as soon as i get the hang of this theyll switch the controls on me,0,53,4,4,184
try to do a fly by,0,818,6,6,147
i remember what the letters were right,0,57,5,5,1154
mumbles im only pressing the shoot button and the rotate button at the same time,0,300,5,5,300
24 too fast,0,211,10,10,137
i see a foe mine mumbles moving again slowly,0,300,2,2,235
mumbles that was fast,0,788,9,9,169
alright thats my best game yet,0,41,5,5,470
p alrighty,0,41,4,4,414
so like here you go shows how he is turning to stay in the hexagon then here,0,214,5,5,301
alright,0,558,10,10,76
its just the amount you press the acceleration key like it pushes you forward,0,214,5,5,305
going too fast going too fast,0,319,9,9,221
i am trying to navigate but nothing is working and im just flying around without oh there we go,0,20,1,1,396
alright go right go that way go backwards,0,20,5,5,580
ahh alright that is t u j,0,20,2,2,427
maybe i should move in a circle because my best score came when i got 0 kills but moved in a circle,0,400,4,4,89
ok theres ok 24 i almost got it and if i stay in the center and outside the hexagon i should have the theres a dollar sign,0,569,3,3,136
forward,0,51,8,8,340
stay inside the hexagon,0,130,10,10,414
one personal space two personal space,0,53,3,3,113
kay bad mine interval too slow,0,41,9,9,593
no stop stop,0,14,4,4,569
im going so fast,0,28,6,6,257
one more turn,0,29,10,10,609
im definitely not earning points for the control,0,468,6,6,127
nope keep mumbles cannot get it to stay in the hexagon,0,52,3,3,564
okay this is difficult to control,0,52,1,1,485
alright 5 hits on the vulnerability counter,0,372,2,2,31
i dont like going into hyperspace but sometimes hyperspace is the only way you can get away,0,804,8,8,372
turn turn turn,0,127,9,9,264
yeah go forward,0,28,3,3,140
i got no control over this and its bad,0,49,2,2,324
getting out of control,0,319,7,7,181
but im moving i dont,0,54,10,10,466
p slow down bonus missiles,0,50,9,9,108
going nice and slow,0,41,5,5,454
yup turn then move,0,16,6,6,447
left,0,51,10,10,429
its best to use light taps to move the ship around rather than long drawnout ones or else itll get crazy and start flying everywhere,0,681,2,2,238
im not going to try to go in the clockwise motion im just going to shoot at it and hope for the best,0,411,2,2,29
oh i still cant control the ship and ive been playing this for a little while now its insane,0,214,3,3,248
okay gotta get in control,0,214,10,10,408
i try simultaneously pressing the forward and right button seeing if that helps the control,0,300,3,3,246
mine cane okay gotta really figure out how to control my ship here go the opposite direction so i want okay now im in like a good like,0,41,3,3,397
were gonna go the optimal path this time alright gonna turn around alright lets gothats not that fast,0,818,1,1,7
i just care about getting shot because the fortress shoots you very fast,0,400,2,2,63
alright shot it again,0,473,7,7,305
alright a so,0,473,1,1,164
now im lost in hyperspace trying to gain control,0,468,7,7,144
im missing a lot of point right now,0,34,1,1,41
alright,0,319,2,2,28
theres one right here so i got the bonus,0,848,4,4,265
alright this does nothin,0,16,5,5,348
so very much needs to slow down,0,12,3,3,441
alright so for our last trial i will try and stay in the fortress as best as possible following the original game plan of spinning clockwise while trying to avoid the mines and shots,0,848,10,10,396
d friendly im in a bad spot ah man im not going very fast but not slow either,0,404,6,6,234
no alright alright ok nope nope turn,0,210,3,3,32
and keep flying and control is actually good but my points suck,0,33,8,8,831
gimme that right back,0,16,6,6,452
interval was right,0,34,1,1,37
slow down,0,739,9,9,89
alright so this time we will try and not to suffer mumbles this game is a little more just kinda rogue flying around not 100 staying within the boundaries but trying to not go into hyperspace,0,848,8,8,363
um its not worth going in a circle,0,3,3,3,50
cant do anything else right,0,52,3,3,596
im more of a controller person,0,53,2,2,58
there and zs out 6 7 8 9 losing control losing control 10 oh,0,825,6,6,189
trying to avoid this hyper space is harder than i thought,0,210,6,6,81
i could fire at that if i knew how to turn,0,52,5,5,690
alright thats one dollar sign thats one dollar sign,0,16,3,3,199
alright come on,0,16,9,9,716
need to control the ship,0,28,5,5,231
just trying to get a slow kinda like slide past the tower,0,24,4,4,96
ah man okay so this thing in the hexagon,0,130,5,5,327
im just kinda going in circles,0,468,6,6,109
i didnt turn fast enough,0,46,9,9,597
i just clicked the right one,0,54,4,4,269
no left,0,51,10,10,428
come on man how fast i gotta click,0,16,7,7,540
yea i can do l turn it into,0,52,5,5,676
i feel like everytime i lose slight control i just fly off into space,0,12,2,2,424
gosh until you lose control,0,214,3,3,244
alright nope nope nope nope nope nope nope,0,818,2,2,19
stop spinning fly direct,0,210,4,4,40
p it accelerates really really fast and then,0,130,1,1,236
okay perfect its missing me so im doing good right now,0,34,10,10,478
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,6,6,438
cant go backwards,0,51,6,6,224
and mumbles 6 shots left,0,432,10,10,214
p vyb alright vyb,0,127,6,6,213
so much for control points,0,12,6,6,541
no not fast enough,0,400,5,5,99
alright thats two down,0,16,3,3,244
and yeah im so focused on controlling myself that i cant but its coming easier soon ill be able to get this fortress,0,214,6,6,319
so i guess my strategy is to just go around it and shoot at the fortress and make it go as slow as i can,0,211,2,2,31
p oh ok its moving very fast,0,211,1,1,3
p okay my points never gonna im never gonna get high points cuz i wrap the screen too much so,0,16,2,2,171
mumbles have to turn it into a ooh dollar sigh,0,52,6,6,707
alright,0,454,3,3,180
one come on slow down slow down,0,53,7,7,297
need to slow down,0,14,4,4,562
alright so i think i got a strategy going,0,568,3,3,68
slow down ship,0,214,3,3,257
alright so i gotta retry the strategy i gotta get it going straight first which is the tricky part,0,848,2,2,221
i cant slow it down,0,127,5,5,208
okay okay alright nice and slow,0,41,1,1,319
okay turn,0,54,1,1,189
all right so thatll take like forever to get used to i guess,0,12,1,1,345
if i dont do it right than im just im dead,0,40,3,3,64
slow down,0,28,6,6,259
turn turn turn,0,127,6,6,218
mine came at me i couldnt press fast enough,0,300,2,2,237
bonus left,0,27,6,6,111
gotta be fast,0,647,7,7,206
alright you have to be a pro gamer to do well in this game,0,20,7,7,666
p  alright,0,319,4,4,92
counterclockwise huh maybe i was wrong,0,53,3,3,94
hey alright mumbles,0,30,6,6,291
im not good mumbles that can actually like stay they just like stay in the hexagon i just feel like they dont go out to the screen that often,0,57,9,9,1404
i keep doing better when it brings me in because when im out on the edges its way more difficult,0,211,4,4,49
4 5 6 7 8 you know if you go to hyperspace you just confuse the please dont die im so close 9 more tod no tod,0,41,7,7,524
what left,0,51,10,10,398
turn and thrust and then turn and then thrust,0,53,10,10,472
alright im going to try this again,0,20,9,9,734
alright this is a little bit easier to control,0,372,2,2,22
hyperspace captain,0,53,4,4,174
alright,0,28,10,10,422
counterclockwise,0,432,8,8,183
and a little bit forward,0,28,4,4,172
okay score is slowly going up,0,681,3,3,249
its off the screen,0,3,4,4,72
were at 5 vulnerability right now so that nice,0,34,2,2,72
it doesnt really matter where youre facing you have to keep moving to not get shot but stop moving by turning completely around and going in that direction,0,513,3,3,49
turn thrust,0,53,10,10,477
and then just trying to stay inside the hexagon,0,130,2,2,244
key is doing it slow and steady i too quick avoid avoid okay,0,41,5,5,453
alright lemmy learn how to turn,0,16,4,4,274
too fast,0,127,6,6,216
p stay inside this hexagon,0,50,6,6,64
p yeah i dont really got a lot of thoughts right now,0,49,1,1,264
its very difficult to control the thing and i wish this guy would stop trying to shoot me and lets see,0,47,1,1,5
yeah its just really hard with the arrows keys to keep your ship in control while its moving around frictionless,0,681,1,1,202
slow slow down,0,404,4,4,145
ah moving pretty fast now i gotta slow down a bit,0,404,3,3,102
alright,0,28,6,6,247
mumbles dont want to go out of bounds because it completely completely flips the guy so its confusing,0,57,3,3,1011
umm but so i guess the what you were saying was like youre trying to accelerate in the,0,468,2,2,22
p im trying to slow this ship down and tilt it a little bit forward but it keeps going faster which really sucks,0,411,4,4,53
alright thats one down,0,16,7,7,536
it already hit me theres so many theyre all interfering with each other i cant remember which ones were the right ones,0,190,3,3,158
all right i just wanna try getting the hang of just going around the recurrent way,0,57,2,2,895
p no no i wish i did i just gotta get a hold of the controls for the most part i was actually like spinning around inside the hexagon a little bit but it was just that those mines really like got me scared a little bit and i just like lost control and like ok how do i get this back,0,568,2,2,58
im just like gonna tap right now,0,49,1,1,265
if i could turn this thing,0,29,9,9,580
no zoom velocity,0,57,4,4,1039
turn turn turn,0,127,10,10,276
p oer try slowing down a bit,0,29,4,4,403
i didnt realize i was going to be moving,0,54,1,1,180
im losing points as im in hyperspace,0,57,6,6,1218
okay yeah so you have to like point before you can move forward,0,214,1,1,205
okay stay within the lines mumble hyperspace,0,804,10,10,419
okay wow im losing so many points right now,0,34,7,7,358
more control i get over it the slower i move it and what ends up happening is i get hit by the enemy fortress,0,404,4,4,144
i cant even stay in the circle,0,20,1,1,391
p im clicking the right mouse,0,33,9,9,863
the optimal flight pattern that i had initially thought of is not the one im taking,0,12,2,2,411
alright im out one,0,16,6,6,490
turn turn turn turn around turn around there you go,0,210,5,5,58
turn and oh dead,0,28,3,3,143
fast enough to make it work,0,40,3,3,66
always be turning,0,513,3,3,50
its just staying inside this hexagon is the worst part,0,685,5,5,106
turn again this way,0,57,2,2,902
alright come on come on,0,16,6,6,489
alright turn,0,28,4,4,194
almost got a full circle,0,739,9,9,98
focus to get inside the hexagon,0,300,1,1,199
its easier to stay in hyperspace than inside the hexagon,0,300,2,2,232
alright space bar,0,190,2,2,128
i gotta stop missing,0,24,5,5,119
alright get out that shit,0,16,10,10,820
alright well i always seem to keep getting shot at so im juts going to move around,0,54,7,7,392
nope no i just did a complete circle for some reason,0,818,6,6,138
slow down dude,0,53,1,1,29
slash um im flying really slow in a straight line,0,3,8,8,163
just flying all over the place,0,818,9,9,241
slow down,0,127,6,6,225
trying to move inch by inch but its so hard to do,0,12,5,5,529
slow down,0,131,2,2,35
im dead flying off in random direction that was quick,0,14,3,3,514
alright,0,685,1,1,6
alright umm see a mine i hit it head on it disappeared so im guessing it didnt do damage and its friendly,0,468,7,7,151
stop moving stop moving,0,16,4,4,308
alright,0,28,1,1,4
see im already at 500 but i didnt even realize cuz my control is at positive velocity and points for the whole negative,0,49,8,8,455
p im still struggling to fly in a counterclockwise direction and im also out of the hexagon and now im waiting for the next mine its k which means its a friend but i dont think im supposed to shoot it cause its a friend,0,45,3,3,20
try to do a fly by,0,818,6,6,146
slow down,0,51,5,5,150
hey stop alright alright alright alright just die die,0,113,5,5,397
so now we got a little more movement so i think i can start to incorporate everything else,0,214,8,8,352
got the bonus right just gotta shoot it,0,404,4,4,152
you know what i have left im going to make them useful,0,113,6,6,424
ok that was right,0,411,3,3,38
whatcha alright come here,0,16,10,10,770
turn go straight,0,210,10,10,169
im actually at negative points right now,0,568,1,1,19
alright so first dollar sign wow daf,0,130,7,7,354
alright,0,214,2,2,222
this is virtually impossible i cant get myself to control this thing,0,214,1,1,184
slow down,0,51,7,7,234
this stick is really alright,0,568,1,1,23
slow down a bit,0,34,9,9,439
its very hard to control,0,404,1,1,10
i can actually control it a little bit,0,190,1,1,111
i just feels weird using a joystick to control a little stick plane,0,43,1,1,121
uh thrusters off,0,57,1,1,847
slow down,0,14,3,3,527
its a foe and i didnt even realize fast enough,0,49,8,8,454
p okay look stop there you go,0,214,4,4,276
okay i need to stop dying,0,113,2,2,305
and i cant even turn,0,16,4,4,294
its moving already,0,16,1,1,13
its tripping and i circle it,0,49,9,9,486
alright so,0,54,4,4,263
it doesnt really give you time to think because it moves so fast,0,977,1,1,54
alright come on,0,16,4,4,285
okay i can turn this way,0,16,7,7,516
i cant move throughout the hexagon,0,130,9,9,406
i dont know how im supposed to shoot the means because im just freaking flying dumb flight path,0,20,3,3,502
slow down,0,127,10,10,282
shooting as i move across it,0,300,10,10,411
staying inside the hexagon pretty well this time,0,809,6,6,103
yeah im flying all over the place here,0,127,2,2,158
alright stick and move,0,16,4,4,326
this is the 5th game and i still have not mastered the flight pattern,0,20,5,5,558
i pressed that too fast,0,12,4,4,487
slow down,0,51,7,7,256
too fast,0,56,7,7,108
alright buddy come on,0,568,3,3,65
thats my last chance right here,0,49,9,9,492
alright qhd lets go,0,568,1,1,5
i didnt not realize that there would be acceleration in this which kind of makes it tougher,0,400,1,1,53
im able to stay in the control zone a little bit better this time,0,404,2,2,57
ill just take that hit i guess and control for it,0,12,9,9,657
yeah the problem is the velocity points i cant even slow it down,0,127,5,5,199
p um yeah im kinda trying to get it to go as slow as i can because it moves very fast,0,211,2,2,30
mumbles alright,0,568,1,1,16
all right lets do this,0,55,9,9,982
p so the controls have not switched up on me,0,53,9,9,397
oh enter thats right,0,33,1,1,560
moving toward the fortress,0,300,1,1,206
tell her to slow down,0,131,2,2,52
p alright,0,16,2,2,90
i keep going in circles,0,468,6,6,132
alright come on,0,16,8,8,670
thats a foe but i didnt do it fast enough,0,49,8,8,461
slow down slow down,0,127,4,4,184
umm ah back in hyperspace,0,468,7,7,149
so trying to stay within the hexagon,0,468,7,7,139
okay i didnt know that those mines could move,0,51,1,1,13
money sign left click bonus,0,681,8,8,304
alright turn turn turn turn,0,210,6,6,83
so i should stop missing,0,3,7,7,143
okay oh okay now i understand so forward is forward and im just moving left and right  if i wanna decrease the speed i actually dont know how to do that,0,468,1,1,8
alright i am at 11 and i dont think i know exactly what to do there we go,0,558,10,10,71
i guess im just not doing it fast enough,0,127,8,8,252
quails stop x rays,0,53,10,10,465
nope stop,0,14,4,4,587
and hyper drive i didnt wanna do that,0,14,4,4,589
learn how to move,0,16,8,8,672
p oh man alright im going for it,0,190,4,4,173
nope nope turn around turn there you go turn turn,0,210,3,3,35
like what im thinking is it pushes you forward really fast and um so like when it pushes you you need to change directions to slow down or else youll go flying,0,214,5,5,306
oh i am clicking too slow on the intervals with the enemy enemy mines,0,404,7,7,256
im using backspace and it doesnt go back,0,54,5,5,301
nope too fast,0,788,8,8,161
out of control still,0,319,10,10,258
turn,0,28,10,10,462
im doing good with mines and going off the screen,0,51,5,5,172
stinkin move,0,16,5,5,404
i got to slow down,0,34,7,7,334
damn these shits movin faster,0,16,5,5,424
okay left turn,0,27,1,1,10
alright no,0,28,3,3,124
how do you go forward again,0,57,8,8,1324
alright bet,0,16,5,5,429
qwk i think double right click and then kill that thing,0,52,8,8,795
well hyper space is an easy way to get away from mines but you start moving too quickly yoawe come on,0,14,6,6,648
p yeah like maybe i should try shooting some more but just wanna get the control thing first down so you like,0,468,3,3,44
alright,0,28,9,9,371
turn thrust turn thrust turn thrust,0,53,10,10,481
left,0,20,7,7,657
stop hitting me,0,29,2,2,354
tqj alright yes,0,404,4,4,136
can you slow down,0,113,8,8,494
so now we are trying to get back into the hexagon unfortunately there is a foe mine on the screen that hasnt been shot so luckily i was able to avoid it,0,848,8,8,367
alright we have to wait 250 milliseconds before each shot,0,20,5,5,566
yeah the counterclockwise thing is not working for me,0,52,7,7,767
get back on ok go slow again fix the aim,0,300,8,8,371
going out of control really wrecks your points,0,647,10,10,246
slow down,0,51,10,10,455
o thats a friendly alright,0,404,10,10,381
alright,0,29,4,4,408
im on level 10 h too fast,0,211,8,8,112
so i dont understand how when i stay still i get control points,0,54,10,10,465
p alright round two what am i going to do,0,825,1,1,44
slow down,0,51,7,7,271
nice and slow,0,41,9,9,582
still going too fast second dollar sign,0,319,7,7,183
the letter is l so im not very good at controlling this,0,3,1,1,12
ya know if i was good enough i could keep it in a circle that would be pretty cool,0,818,5,5,112
there we go and now just turn and a little bit of speed,0,51,2,2,38
terrible control score,0,41,2,2,377
the controls get out of whack very easily,0,14,1,1,456
i only wish that there was a slow down button,0,411,8,8,125
um this is very hard to control,0,739,1,1,9
wait ok i lost control,0,210,2,2,20
alright come on i got the turn game now,0,16,5,5,381
were gona go slow the joystick is going to help me,0,52,8,8,805
let me try to slow down,0,3,7,7,135
um i need to stop,0,54,6,6,366
okay gonna go a lot slower,0,24,2,2,52
i was too slow on the interval that time to get the mine,0,681,3,3,247
stay in the hexagon man,0,49,4,4,357
p at the moment it feels like my thoughts are like just how to get around how do i turn like how do i keep straight how do i um do this or do that like,0,825,1,1,23
we just have to be going at the right velocity,0,848,9,9,375
p alright,0,739,1,1,6
alrighty,0,155,1,1,138
alright you my friend,0,16,3,3,193
can you please stop it,0,29,10,10,602
slow down,0,51,7,7,233
or stop missing,0,3,7,7,139
p alright that was pretty bad,0,29,2,2,346
slow down,0,51,7,7,282
okay thats how you move,0,27,1,1,5
i want to come back into the hexagon and just stay there,0,52,1,1,516
theres a mine on the screen,0,55,4,4,689
screen wrap really takes the points out of my system so if i could just avoid screen wrap then i shouldnt be mumbles,0,404,10,10,374
going to the bottom of the hexagon fire a few shots again,0,300,9,9,387
p alright zmr are the foe mines,0,372,6,6,72
slow down,0,51,9,9,366
turn around turn around make a right for forward,0,20,6,6,615
the control is a little loose,0,210,1,1,4
alright it blacked out,0,210,1,1,13
did not react fast enough,0,12,6,6,545
oh alright i already forgot the letters,0,190,3,3,157
alright imma get it back,0,16,10,10,811
you could have told me that that probably wouldnt have made a difference if you press the two middle keys together it kinda keeps them in a rotation,0,49,4,4,367
okay please stop oh wait,0,41,4,4,436
okay trying trying to go slowly,0,24,1,1,39
i have no control of this ship,0,113,3,3,332
its not like when you get hit by the missiles and the screen starts but its like the mine hits you it freezes,0,818,6,6,133
in the hexagon in the hexagon,0,28,1,1,41
alright bonus points left missiles,0,16,1,1,4
damn every time i think i have the flight pattern down i dont,0,20,6,6,605
slow down slow down,0,53,5,5,208
okay were just gonna keep going right,0,818,9,9,223
oh alright it repeats again,0,20,2,2,459
alright i missed,0,809,2,2,42
okay im going way to fast with the speed,0,34,4,4,177
left,0,910,1,1,17
alright managed to hit the enemy got the vulnerability 1 vulnerability 2,0,404,7,7,254
p alright,0,20,1,1,384
cant seem to get it to go right,0,804,3,3,260
i keep on dying but staying inside the hexagon is really hard wow i just got second bonus,0,130,6,6,349
i need to learn how to move,0,16,8,8,654
need to turn around,0,55,9,9,954
mumbles trying to make my ship so i can move to a clockwise,0,300,9,9,388
i keep losing control,0,788,8,8,159
since the movement is so hard,0,12,5,5,520
mine is on screen it is t,0,3,4,4,69
turn around aw man,0,818,10,10,253
im worried about flying it and i cant this is a lot harder than i thought,0,55,1,1,550
and go forward,0,28,7,7,289
nope nope slow down no slow the f come on man,0,16,10,10,808
ship is going very very fast,0,804,6,6,302
so much for the counterclockwise or the clock wise,0,52,4,4,612
bonus i keep flying around that works ok,0,569,7,7,204
rotating to the right,0,300,1,1,203
alright successful,0,825,4,4,147
alright first dollar sign,0,788,8,8,154
im surprised im negative 700 points right now,0,825,1,1,18
alright onf alright i can do that,0,16,1,1,8
alright thats one,0,16,4,4,318
im not even im not even trying to avoid it im just out of control right now,0,155,6,6,238
ah gotta keep it on the screen,0,739,5,5,51
so try to stasy in the hexagon but thats really hard tot do,0,12,1,1,346
is it the same controls,0,190,2,2,126
p alright,0,848,4,4,255
3 4 5 alright 6 alright 9 okay it disappeared and got no,0,29,8,8,559
turn,0,57,1,1,851
alright so dollar sign,0,14,9,9,811
alright this joystick,0,16,1,1,23
stop it,0,113,2,2,299
alright viw,0,20,3,3,493
no dont go into hyperspace,0,29,2,2,352
focus on shooting the fortress and staying inside the hexagon right now,0,300,7,7,349
i cant get this darn thing to slow down,0,127,6,6,222
like whats going on okay i should definitely go a little more slow,0,214,2,2,225
the mines go very fast as well,0,24,1,1,24
now its really the mines cause i realized the fortress doesnt really shoot like i can easily dodge like move away from its shots umm so like the mines are doing things to me now,0,411,7,7,106
and im just going like out of the bounds,0,214,1,1,204
ok let me just get inside the control,0,404,9,9,359
alright,0,41,10,10,632
mumbles turn,0,56,5,5,55
alright come on,0,16,10,10,807
and im already moving way too fast,0,14,2,2,499
p alright,0,54,2,2,203
im kind of spinning right now,0,468,8,8,179
moving way too fast,0,3,9,9,178
switches from left hand to right hand,0,685,1,1,11
any chance i could play this with my right hand,0,818,1,1,4
alright i got a friendly mine n thats,0,404,6,6,226
slow down,0,51,6,6,197
right heres another thing that im supposed to get but i think that was the first one but im honestly not paying attention to that,0,47,1,1,7
i think my new strategy is going to juts to avid this guy and just to stay on the hexagon because thats all i can kind of do,0,52,7,7,759
im im the key is entering hyperspace and just taking points,0,41,3,3,392
stop shooting me,0,818,10,10,256
hey are these controllers ok,0,214,1,1,192
alright come on,0,16,8,8,630
but trying to gain points for velocity and points,0,848,2,2,216
no why dont you turn,0,210,7,7,94
p i keep pulling backwards on the joystick even though it doesnt work,0,50,7,7,82
im going way too fast,0,3,5,5,84
i gotta turn and boost turn boost turn boost turn boost turn boost,0,16,3,3,217
im thinking that i really have to learn to slow down and how to control my ship if i learn how to do that then that means i can definitely win this game multiple times,0,41,6,6,506
i have not been able to keep control as  i accidently shot a foe mine and it blew me up,0,848,6,6,309
getting that dollar sign right,0,647,5,5,178
mumbles out of control,0,319,4,4,105
clockwise right,0,26,2,2,14
oh out of control now,0,319,3,3,54
oh jeeze oh my god slow down,0,53,1,1,31
1 alright mumbles alright 3 on the vulnerability counter,0,372,7,7,86
it starts firing at you right when you get started,0,809,4,4,70
jkl no it was jkh right,0,977,3,3,68
alright r friendly mine got the hit,0,404,7,7,270
and ive just lost control,0,818,4,4,76
alright back lemmy get them points,0,16,3,3,203
control your speed,0,51,6,6,183
alright 25 shots,0,685,10,10,224
p alright i hit it,0,404,5,5,185
alright trying to get into a good path,0,319,3,3,50
and rotation,0,30,8,8,447
and alright,0,54,10,10,450
i have no other optimal path other than going to the right,0,818,6,6,123
i need to get in control of you,0,113,8,8,487
the biggest problem is definitely keeping this thing under control and then once you do that theres definitely better ways to capitalize on the mines but im pretty sure you can just shoot them all so i dont know,0,47,6,6,95
im just going to go like that points up screen and its going to go up continuously,0,53,8,8,378
mumbles go inside 50 36 shots left,0,26,9,9,153
ohh vulnerability is gone too fast,0,211,7,7,93
moving back inside the hexagon slowing down first,0,300,5,5,301
okay so so starting to get the controls,0,41,1,1,303
p okay alright this is a lot harder than i thought ugh,0,788,1,1,60
you geet used to everytime you respond you have to immediately move again,0,12,3,3,436
cant keep control of the ship but this is hard,0,804,2,2,252
13 shots left,0,26,5,5,81
uh theres an h on the screen mine there was also just a bonus,0,848,8,8,356
alright so,0,33,5,5,720
p alright so for this game we are going to try and stay in the circle best we can oh not the circle hexagon,0,848,3,3,232
i have one shot left,0,52,10,10,896
turn,0,210,10,10,168
turn ok,0,210,7,7,114
p opposite direction so youre like trying to continuously turn i guess,0,468,2,2,23
nice and slow thats an x mine,0,41,1,1,315
moving forward again slowing down,0,300,3,3,263
see if i stop here its gonna shoot me,0,214,6,6,328
accelerates so quickly,0,52,2,2,538
occasionally i try to use thruster to shoot thats not how it works,0,14,5,5,599
just trying to keep it on the screen,0,739,3,3,34
p alright,0,14,8,8,732
4 mumbles mumbles i can control this thing i should nope,0,26,5,5,84
uh t that didnt matter i just ran right into it,0,825,2,2,77
alright well i killed it once ive improved by 1700 points im not that bad,0,41,2,2,376
turn shoot,0,28,9,9,392
alruight right right,0,20,7,7,653
and im not on the right keys,0,57,10,10,1482
stop doing that,0,51,4,4,97
alright just just trying to stabilize,0,30,3,3,127
i just figured out how to move a little better,0,214,8,8,354
slow down,0,51,7,7,287
thrust left right,0,16,2,2,97
get back in the hexagon,0,155,8,8,272
turn shoot,0,28,3,3,123
alright im at vulnerability 6 try to alter my path a little bit,0,404,6,6,229
control control control,0,404,10,10,375
alright ok,0,190,8,8,209
out of control,0,319,5,5,131
laughs alright i got this,0,190,1,1,107
rotate slow again spin to the right very slightly a t i think that was a foe mine,0,300,2,2,229
okay nice and slow managed to get one shot on it,0,41,1,1,326
i wasnt going too fast i stayed inside the hexagon flying maybe the wrong way but mumbles umm yeah so,0,468,5,5,82
i the frictionless space,0,52,5,5,656
im just trying to get the hang of the control,0,404,4,4,165
and then the fact that backwards on the control pad doesnt do anything,0,404,2,2,64
stop,0,127,4,4,180
gonna press slowly gonna shoot diagonals,0,300,4,4,289
gotta try to develop my strategy on the go im not worried about control until that last hit i guess,0,404,5,5,203
the ship wrapped the screen wow 36 times,0,155,6,6,247
p cause it tells you when to change direction and when you change direction you change acceleration,0,214,5,5,312
so i try to stay within that velocity within the fortress i dont think i will have a problem,0,848,5,5,279
p okay umm so im just trying to control the ship right now im getting a tiny better but still not really able to go the other way but still  umm so yeah i think this will take some getting used to,0,468,2,2,19
p my score got really good really fast,0,825,6,6,201
move alright,0,910,1,1,18
alright uh,0,468,1,1,14
p im trying to go clockwise,0,50,1,1,5
p alright so lets youuu,0,28,3,3,122
all right cool,0,57,6,6,1209
okay so if its lrg stop it,0,825,3,3,89
alright now im gonna start shooting the fortress now,0,28,4,4,161
alright so yeah 2373,0,568,2,2,52
p now im going out of control,0,45,3,3,23
i cant really stop this thing,0,130,1,1,214
its a foe so now i have 1 left,0,46,7,7,514
okay so i managed to stay on the screen,0,57,6,6,1202
and hes moving faster than usual it seems like,0,20,3,3,474
and turn again,0,155,2,2,162
and it seems that sometimes he doesnt shoot me but sometimes he does like depending on where i am on the screen,0,47,10,10,145
so we move around,0,14,10,10,840
so hopefully we can get it this time and just trying to stay inside the hexagon oh no its too fast,0,130,3,3,262
also shooting the fortress to destroy it at the same time the dollar sign is on the screen,0,848,10,10,405
this game is like slowly destroying my confidence at playing games,0,411,6,6,99
alright yeah,0,214,1,1,199
okay moving toward the fortress this time move forward,0,300,1,1,205
it was slower,0,53,8,8,393
i keep going into hyperspace so that not good losing points,0,34,1,1,39
p full game mumbles rules that are written on screen,0,53,6,6,242
kinda giving up on control but maybe i can do better on velocity,0,46,9,9,580
no dont go off the screen,0,14,6,6,646
too fast too fast too fast too fast,0,14,8,8,752
im not doing very well at all right now,0,809,1,1,27
slow down,0,53,7,7,339
i dont now how to control this,0,29,5,5,482
oh my god stop killing me,0,113,5,5,398
okay go forward,0,28,5,5,220
go you got move,0,51,10,10,462
slowly,0,56,10,10,181
alright i just got killed,0,372,8,8,97
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,6,6,466
and like i cant i have a problem talking and like controlling myself like i cant even do that,0,214,4,4,281
there you go slow down,0,57,3,3,1009
right click cant kill him,0,33,10,10,913
all right,0,55,8,8,902
p i just didnt realize the ship was so sensitive that just tapping the arrow it would fly off the screen,0,190,2,2,122
i cant control it,0,33,1,1,561
i think the best thing that has worked for me is to just stay still and not thrust it forward,0,54,1,1,190
alright lets get it,0,16,3,3,250
going slow trying to get that vulnerability,0,300,8,8,374
im flying in circles a bunch,0,468,6,6,120
32 shots left continuing,0,910,4,4,108
mumbles slowing down trying to get away from that its a b so im going to shoot it,0,300,4,4,274
p alright good maybe ill get a little better,0,685,1,1,23
i dont know how to slow down,0,57,1,1,876
oops no no were gonna start flying around,0,818,5,5,92
i wish i could juts stay in the hexagon like,0,52,5,5,671
so for this one i am actually going to try a different strategy of just going straight on the screen losing points for whats it called control,0,848,2,2,215
alright well im taking a bunch of hits im going to explode in 1 more hit,0,825,6,6,182
slowing down again,0,300,5,5,307
try to go real slow,0,739,5,5,54
no thats an enemy but i pressed it too fast,0,12,5,5,517
is that a 10 its a right double click,0,647,2,2,138
p right now like my problem is when i click the other one my ship just takes off and i lose control,0,49,3,3,327
oh no is it too fast,0,34,5,5,229
okay alright got some points,0,30,2,2,105
like see it hasnt shot me even though its moving really slow around it i dont think its gonna shoot,0,214,6,6,327
i died that time right,0,211,4,4,60
because its more opportune to just hit it but then youre out of the hexagon and losing points cuz youre going so fast,0,977,2,2,62
mumbles i got 3 4 4 alright still 4,0,372,5,5,68
right now im trying to spin around and stay within the hexagon which had been proven better for me this time,0,848,7,7,337
oh youre a friend oh crap i cant slow down okay,0,113,9,9,511
only a few shots left,0,432,10,10,212
alright,0,43,6,6,172
p make the spacebar a pause button,0,56,6,6,74
i would like you to stop shooting me right now,0,569,2,2,130
starting all over pressing forward moving slower this time,0,300,1,1,200
umm just trying to control the ship right now umm definitely definitely gaining some,0,468,6,6,102
this is a really difficult thing to control,0,41,1,1,294
uh right 8,0,825,2,2,78
come here alright theres definitely no there definitely wasnt no o in that shit,0,16,10,10,774
oh too fast there we go,0,211,1,1,10
im staying somewhere within the outer limit of the hexagon,0,300,3,3,260
alright nice fire fire,0,20,2,2,426
im going too slow,0,12,6,6,556
i forget but yeah slowing down is,0,49,1,1,255
gosh this thing goes so fast,0,52,2,2,546
alright not too shabby,0,28,4,4,185
im going to stop shooting because i only have 7 shots left,0,54,6,6,355
every time i see phf im going to double right click,0,52,7,7,746
slow down,0,51,7,7,286
lemmy try to see if i can control,0,29,3,3,393
i need to turn around,0,54,5,5,328
ohhh turn turn,0,57,8,8,1343
alright just coast,0,818,4,4,72
lemmy try to get the hang of this right now,0,29,6,6,488
p alright here we go,0,47,6,6,80
oh too fast too fast,0,300,3,3,255
because im pretty sure to destroy the mines its tapping the right clicker or i forget i dont really know what exactly to call it but i am not entirely sure if its actually doing anything,0,558,6,6,44
alright i got almost there,0,404,3,3,100
p i float off so fast its not even worth getting the bonus,0,18,5,5,37
but still control is at an alltime minimum,0,558,4,4,22
learn how to move,0,16,8,8,671
velocity was better,0,46,9,9,599
alright alright alright,0,113,10,10,540
when it when it says wrapped the screen that means that i went outside the screen,0,55,8,8,924
gonna try to start controlling the ship a little bit more,0,404,4,4,137
the concept is simple but the controls are another story,0,804,2,2,255
slow slow,0,51,3,3,81
ive lost control this is when it gets bad,0,34,9,9,424
ah the ship doesnt move fast enough,0,404,4,4,140
yeah like if you just try to flow with the hexagon you should be able to stay in the bounds,0,214,5,5,296
ive watched dragon ball z this is the easiest,0,825,8,8,234
in hyperspace,0,24,1,1,29
what i didnt understand was i thought i was respawning every time i go into the screen,0,214,2,2,219
stop,0,24,1,1,40
5 alright no darn it,0,825,3,3,116
turn right,0,57,3,3,1019
6 7 8 i think its not right,0,29,4,4,424
oop the screen went black,0,411,1,1,14
alrighty that was my best one yet and its over thats how it should be,0,41,5,5,469
very fast,0,848,1,1,195
slow down,0,51,6,6,215
uh slow down but that doesnt work,0,52,6,6,725
so if you do this you wrap the screen a bunch but you move so fast the fortress cant get to you until a mine comes,0,977,7,7,99
but im oh its much faster than i thought originally so slow down,0,848,1,1,194
um slow slow hey,0,53,4,4,166
definitely try tookay already going counterclockwise,0,468,8,8,188
oh no turn and then thrust turn and then thrust,0,53,10,10,475
alright come on,0,16,5,5,384
p no the ship if its on the right path i just have to focus on shooting and changing directions,0,432,9,9,194
try to stay in the hexagon,0,28,3,3,131
still going too fast,0,319,5,5,125
my ship wrapped around the screen 45 times,0,658,1,1,19
slow slow and steady wins the race,0,30,3,3,142
alright,0,28,10,10,435
i guess its just a little frustrating trying to navigate something like as you say its in hyperspace and thats just im just not used to that,0,127,2,2,161
once you have it under control its not that difficult,0,432,2,2,117
alright i just got bullets because i dont want to have to worry about that so im at 100 now get out of the way zach come on,0,685,5,5,102
im getting the control down a lot more right as i say that i kind of get out of control there,0,404,9,9,353
oh its fast,0,217,1,1,33
p points control velocity speed,0,54,10,10,448
trying to fix my trajectory in a clockwise again,0,300,8,8,368
proabbly i stayed still too often to slow down,0,12,8,8,640
i think the hardest part for me is the controlling and also the mines,0,47,7,7,110
i can go forward,0,28,6,6,255
thats the hardest part honestly im just trying to control the thing umm and not go into warp speed gonna try to shoot a little bit,0,404,2,2,61
they say the best strategy is to stay inside the hexagon but thats really hard to do,0,685,6,6,133
well the mines move really fairly slow enough to react if youre not flying into hyperspace,0,12,2,2,399
just entered hyperspace,0,41,1,1,333
p just space button,0,404,1,1,46
stop spinning whats up with the spinning,0,210,4,4,41
alright come on,0,51,4,4,112
rotate rotate,0,30,6,6,293
alright i see what imma do,0,16,10,10,784
okay slow down,0,51,8,8,334
moving slow just focusing on shooting,0,300,10,10,408
im moving a little too fast here,0,14,9,9,821
i have no control whatsoever,0,804,6,6,304
im not even worrying about the mines right now because im still trying to get the hang of the controls so im just focusing on killing fortress so once i get that down i can start to work on the mines,0,681,1,1,212
alright so for this one im gonna try to take it nice and slow and stay in the hexagon and try to not get shot and whenever mines come uh try and deal with them as quickly as possible,0,848,4,4,258
alright so mouse left mouse center,0,54,5,5,285
p alright,0,804,10,10,397
p slower slow,0,50,4,4,38
nope slow down slow down,0,14,7,7,721
but i can turn it that into a friendly uh yeah,0,52,3,3,574
always starts right away,0,46,5,5,443
and come back all right im good,0,57,1,1,845
get going clockwise,0,46,1,1,363
got it right in the kisser,0,41,4,4,441
alright so how will i try this game,0,848,9,9,373
alright this is a good strategy for me here i might not get a lot of points but i might actually,0,404,7,7,266
gotta slow down this ship man,0,49,4,4,363
i cant even slow this down,0,51,1,1,10
now turn this way,0,51,9,9,346
f alright just gonna let it hit me,0,681,2,2,237
turn around,0,54,4,4,272
i dont know what im clicking right now,0,155,1,1,148
like i dont know some people cut their steak with their right hand and then they switch hands to like scoop rice or whatever,0,53,4,4,159
at this point i just have to slowly drift off and not get shot at,0,411,8,8,126
alright trying to get into a good path,0,319,2,2,42
stop going off the screen,0,29,9,9,590
once you like once i like lose control i like cant get it back,0,43,5,5,162
i have 69 shots left so plenty,0,848,3,3,244
wont turn around pressed it once,0,55,2,2,588
alright,0,16,4,4,286
not the right interval messed up going too fast,0,319,6,6,161
moving too fast moving too fast,0,14,1,1,448
its really difficult to control this like i know it looks not hard,0,41,2,2,372
now we are trying to stay on the right side because there is some problem with the fortresss right side apparently,0,848,6,6,311
turn,0,51,5,5,160
okay so lets slow down slow down,0,34,9,9,423
my intervals are too fast i should slow down,0,130,6,6,341
i forget theres no slowing down and the thing is if you forget the letters your whole game will be off so,0,49,5,5,373
1528 uninterpretable alright get him out of here,0,16,4,4,333
alrighty cant shoot it too fast,0,14,2,2,500
ah mumbles got out of control about to get nailed by the fortress shot,0,404,6,6,233
its at one time right now oh it ok,0,20,2,2,460
p but you have to be inside the control zone,0,404,8,8,284
the interval is 2 right now ah theres a mine its a friendly mine so its ok,0,404,3,3,89
alright so thats one of them,0,33,6,6,753
there alright thats one,0,16,4,4,309
i ran right into it because these controls are really difficult,0,41,8,8,557
okay too fast,0,14,9,9,802
move that closer a bit,0,52,8,8,784
youll probably have to hit spacebar again,0,3,1,1,6
p counterclockwise,0,26,2,2,12
going to try to go clockwise,0,300,6,6,329
i realize that during the end of the last game i was only single clicking the right i dont really know what to call it the right mouse thing instead of double clicking it to destroy the foe mines i guess you could say,0,558,4,4,21
im liking this slow speed thing,0,647,3,3,153
ill just sit at the edge here i guess,0,14,2,2,482
turn turn turn turn turn,0,56,6,6,76
i can just shoot it right now,0,33,3,3,638
once i have the ship flying on autopilot in my head i will get better at the game,0,681,1,1,213
i can also feel the snap back if you dont position the joystick back to neutral like a game controller,0,468,3,3,38
its hard to control,0,454,1,1,151
alright im just going to do this,0,113,3,3,317
wrong count on that one i can get it right,0,432,10,10,209
okay turn around and got his way,0,56,8,8,114
just tapping to slow myself down,0,300,1,1,213
its really hard to kill this fortress oh no i left it too early ill get the bonus next time,0,130,10,10,429
okay well i cant get the interval right now but there we go,0,34,8,8,391
didnt get the chance to see rotating the wrong way,0,14,5,5,625
oops too fast and thats e which is not an enemy so umm ok damn it,0,848,1,1,207
so i was not on the right part of the keyboard,0,57,8,8,1323
oh man that was right,0,30,9,9,484
slow down,0,12,3,3,446
alright,0,16,8,8,613
q which is an unfriendly mine ok i just gotta hit it at the right interval,0,404,5,5,184
i got get back into this green hexagon,0,54,1,1,186
umm if i dont move fast enough then the fortress will shoot me,0,404,1,1,41
stick and move stick and move,0,16,3,3,213
p rzl for any and all ending in r oh iots so fast,0,12,1,1,343
p alright cool,0,848,2,2,214
set moving counterclockwise bwe thats a friendly shoot that one,0,910,1,1,15
but like if you keep moving like that you know,0,214,6,6,325
p ird ird alright ird free shot thats annoying there you go,0,41,5,5,446
maybe ill go faster now,0,432,7,7,159
alright,0,51,7,7,285
im enjoying the fact that at least my spaceship goes like an actual airplane  its delightful to see,0,804,5,5,282
controlling 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 awe come on im one more shot,0,41,4,4,417
this is going way too fast,0,739,1,1,10
too bad i keep losing points because i keep going into hyperspace,0,804,7,7,340
but i cant really stay inside the hexagon,0,130,2,2,256
no hyperspace,0,818,6,6,145
alright no okay turn turn this,0,113,2,2,281
trying to stay still aw no thats a bonus nice but last game i kinda shot whenever i wasnt moving too much so staying in control could be the priority since it doesnt really shoot all the time,0,130,9,9,398
p yeah i was ship damaged 20 times by the fortress 8 times by mines destroyed 0 fortress i wrapped the screen 47 times,0,568,1,1,28
alright,0,558,4,4,28
p wow its really fast,0,217,1,1,34
speed 100 velocity 250,0,34,6,6,319
managed to stay in the control zone a lot more,0,404,9,9,336
no overturned it,0,28,5,5,227
okay go forward,0,51,5,5,157
oh man  oh oh my god its really fast,0,130,1,1,213
well were doing good in points right now which is good,0,34,9,9,415
uh its getting out the screen,0,739,10,10,104
this motherworder going fast,0,16,6,6,492
time my shots so theyre between the right millisecond intervals so it doesnt reset,0,681,1,1,199
so its not that much of a mumble and like the mine changes soon like im not worried about the mines either itll move fast enough,0,214,6,6,329
left,0,51,10,10,431
l that needs to be turned oh,0,52,5,5,692
nope im mustve did something right that time,0,20,10,10,801
p well just stop after 10,0,681,5,5,265
in the hexagon,0,28,1,1,43
i got a 9 right now,0,818,7,7,182
alright jyq,0,16,5,5,347
alright thats an e,0,16,7,7,534
ship wrapped around the screen eight times,0,55,7,7,853
alright its a mine,0,24,1,1,23
alright lets try ti get the 10 shot,0,910,4,4,102
every time i fly through so now we can keep doing this and it will remain in the high 400s until we destroy the fortress,0,848,9,9,386
cant control my speed so,0,910,5,5,125
striping across the screen is working for me,0,46,7,7,511
straight left i didnt even look ok,0,20,7,7,674
i have to turn it into a,0,52,2,2,536
apparently shooting it does not work so im gonna have to stop doing that,0,804,10,10,411
alright,0,28,1,1,64
im moving really fast,0,3,2,2,40
fast fast go around,0,210,4,4,45
alright,0,28,4,4,166
p alright thats fine i think its not in between,0,40,5,5,94
slow down,0,51,4,4,114
okay im just going to try and go faster,0,34,3,3,135
p supposed to stay inside this hexagon,0,50,3,3,28
stop coming this way,0,43,5,5,165
and alright,0,30,3,3,112
alright here we go,0,28,1,1,53
let myself fly across,0,20,8,8,690
moving around again gotta speed up,0,300,2,2,234
alright come on come here,0,16,8,8,645
okay were at 3 right now which is nice,0,34,4,4,199
alright my score went down again thats always promising,0,558,5,5,39
p its hard to stay inside of hyperspace,0,454,4,4,195
oh my got its getting faster,0,211,3,3,43
im going backwards,0,468,4,4,52
responding kinda slowly to the mines,0,46,3,3,402
i keep getting pushed out the screen,0,454,3,3,182
i see why they call it hyperspace,0,214,9,9,370
im slowly moving through,0,300,4,4,290
this round i am going to try a new strategy of flying back and forth on the same side,0,848,5,5,277
phf double right click,0,52,7,7,751
and slow down,0,28,7,7,315
alright im only going to shoot why i know thats a friend so bang bang,0,20,10,10,803
p alright next step,0,49,8,8,435
alright things are a little faster than i may have thought they would,0,28,1,1,22
i cant remember i think i have to  if its tba i have to turn it into a,0,52,6,6,739
slow it down,0,28,5,5,207
wowowow a lot stickier than i thought left and right dont correspond,0,977,1,1,50
spaceship doesnt stop at all which doesnt help at all,0,804,1,1,243
one im drifting off into space,0,41,2,2,371
just completely lost control may have died,0,818,2,2,31
turn and go,0,28,7,7,313
alright oh i got 12 i got 12,0,113,4,4,359
its kind of off balance to control,0,210,1,1,9
umm oh so you just bounce off the middle very interesting i wonder if that can be used strategically to stop yourself,0,468,7,7,148
i cant hit the fortress but i have one shot left come on,0,685,7,7,149
p alright closer to zero,0,16,3,3,255
too fast now,0,46,1,1,360
and then i really wish you could slow down any other way,0,12,2,2,405
ive gone into hyperspace like 5 times,0,40,3,3,72
umm its hard to control,0,372,1,1,4
p its kind of hard to control the iff its friendly so,0,50,1,1,7
slow down,0,51,7,7,254
i need to slow down,0,53,4,4,192
like hey yea i got this and actually like flies circles around and actually like defeats it,0,53,4,4,171
im really trying to figure out how to slow down here i know its the opposite direction counterintuitive,0,41,6,6,498
alright,0,26,1,1,5
oh thats an enemy theres a bonus get back on the control 539,0,130,10,10,428
slow slow ah of course,0,53,4,4,164
keep going to the right no dont go into hyperspace,0,818,7,7,180
i guess one of the things that i dont like is that it requires you to move in a pattern instead of just being able to fly around like you dont lose points if you fly around at least then you arent like more,0,411,9,9,136
no we just lost control again,0,818,8,8,212
alright cool,0,53,4,4,145
alright were gonna go out this way we can shoot now go straight clockwise he does not shoot you went youre going fast,0,818,1,1,12
umm t nope that was too fast,0,404,7,7,251
mumbles see im out of control now,0,404,4,4,163
p i gotta use my left hand,0,16,4,4,261
alright,0,28,9,9,381
slowly,0,28,4,4,173
i bet i know how to move,0,16,1,1,48
all right,0,55,5,5,749
stop hitting the center,0,51,9,9,369
stop on the screen and stop it,0,51,8,8,323
slow the fword okay,0,16,8,8,617
i think i have 1 or 2 lives left,0,46,7,7,513
p i still have 2 games left to play 3,0,685,8,8,163
i just tried to right click for shoot i dont know why,0,14,7,7,717
i press the keys too fast,0,12,5,5,505
oh shit dont go off screen,0,131,2,2,36
theres 1 dollar sign and now the second very hard to control and i,0,848,1,1,209
p it seems like you get more points going in circles than shooting it,0,18,8,8,43
going slow so far not pressing the forward so much just going to loop around again,0,300,8,8,365
once you go a little too fast its almost impossible,0,12,10,10,678
or too fast,0,34,1,1,44
alright so im just going to keep shooting and pray something happens,0,113,3,3,333
slow down,0,51,10,10,402
im getting better at identifying the foes and double clicking the correct time interval and i just took the points and i shouldve took the shots because i only have 3 left,0,685,9,9,197
slow interval,0,28,10,10,450
why cant i circle this shit,0,16,3,3,215
going off screen you need to control your speed,0,51,6,6,178
oh that was too fast,0,568,2,2,41
oh if i can rotate i can kill that,0,52,4,4,616
okay so i should probably start moving since that two of the four things that i get my points from,0,54,10,10,449
slow interval and shoot,0,28,10,10,445
okay thats 1 down probably the fastest ill ever do it 1 got the missile 2 3 4 almost 5 you are t you are nothing important,0,825,6,6,190
percent sign not really worried about the bonus right now i have 52 shots,0,41,2,2,356
alright,0,825,2,2,51
god he never stops moving,0,20,2,2,431
going slow making passes,0,300,8,8,370
forward,0,51,8,8,339
alright what is this next one at,0,16,2,2,143
trying to get control is that its hard,0,432,7,7,163
alright come on,0,16,9,9,701
alright so points,0,54,4,4,275
going extremely fast in this game,0,34,1,1,17
press the 4 button for a few times so i can control my speed,0,300,7,7,342
i cant control it,0,788,8,8,156
alright this is the last game i gotta do a lot better than ive been doing,0,685,10,10,213
okay im starting to get in a rhythm of moving around and shooting this thing,0,681,4,4,254
p ah alright,0,20,2,2,421
got 2 right away,0,46,6,6,466
slow down,0,51,6,6,216
gosh youre still out of space,0,214,2,2,217
this is hard to move around,0,54,8,8,410
alright well,0,14,5,5,597
this would be a lot easier i did not expect that to move like that,0,27,1,1,11
alright two shots,0,473,5,5,268
alright so this time we are still trying to stay within the fortress,0,848,6,6,326
ah knew that was gonna happen i was right that was friendly didnt have time to look at the iff there either,0,404,9,9,354
when it starts going too fast thats when it gets dangerous,0,34,7,7,333
phf double right click so hes friendly,0,52,7,7,760
i just shot the fortress twice too fast so i dont want the vulnerability to set back to 0 from 3,0,848,5,5,293
ah man going out of control here ok bonus if that pops up again im gonna hit it,0,404,10,10,377
forget trying to stay in the stupid hexagon,0,14,3,3,541
im already going way to fast,0,52,3,3,561
alright,0,16,3,3,229
stay out of the bounds,0,47,10,10,136
too fast too fast,0,56,4,4,49
im going to press the spacebar,0,20,1,1,385
alright,0,28,5,5,211
ugh right back to zero,0,52,7,7,773
i am at 478 right now only 61 shots left,0,372,3,3,41
p um alright,0,3,1,1,3
its just so hard to keep up with everything at the bottom because it changes so much the game just moves so quickly,0,211,9,9,129
yes only wrapped around the screen eight times and missed two bonuses,0,55,6,6,797
i hit the iff button and i just like guess if im doing it right,0,40,3,3,63
trying to regain control,0,319,5,5,121
stay on the screen,0,739,7,7,74
alright there we go,0,51,2,2,25
p thrust would be 8 clockwise that would be 4 clockwise is right joystick top button which is enter,0,52,3,3,558
keep going into hyperspace,0,804,5,5,287
alright,0,51,4,4,123
slow down,0,51,6,6,201
i gotta remember to move immediately,0,404,5,5,200
trying to stay inside that hexagon,0,300,3,3,249
got the mine alright just keep this speed nope nope nope ill get the hang of this in a couple of more games,0,818,4,4,67
dollar signs popped up one time enemy mine going out of control,0,319,4,4,106
i lost control,0,788,9,9,173
im just going to go out of bounds until you leave me alone,0,113,3,3,319
get that control,0,130,10,10,415
p alrighty so control screen fio,0,41,2,2,341
qwk qwk cutebly k i have it turn it into a friendly mien but i dont know where im clicking,0,52,8,8,786
okay slow down and aim and fire,0,28,4,4,178
okay thats just keep going to the right hyperspaceit,0,818,8,8,206
i got a lot of points for staying in the circle,0,12,10,10,692
alright bvd,0,28,10,10,454
slow down slow down slow down,0,28,10,10,410
right when i get to the end it kills me,0,404,7,7,277
so theres kind of no thinking going on im just trying to control the thing,0,818,1,1,10
p alright,0,910,1,1,22
so i can slow down,0,214,4,4,277
already going too fast,0,52,4,4,610
but the turns cause they move in the hexagon so like they can get you,0,214,6,6,330
slow down,0,51,7,7,257
im trying to control in this and im having a very hard time,0,20,1,1,390
okay they turned up the difficulty,0,41,7,7,512
is that two yep let me get those yeah right back,0,16,6,6,451
p ok alright,0,404,5,5,206
no no stop exiting the screen,0,113,2,2,282
p mouse left,0,51,5,5,126
fresh start how does it make it slow one time,0,52,9,9,839
alright where that shit at,0,16,5,5,362
going a little too fast i gotta compensate,0,681,2,2,228
loosing control,0,818,9,9,233
all right come back,0,57,7,7,1273
mumbling letters at beginning screen oqi oqi,0,404,5,5,176
15 shots left,0,26,10,10,172
there it is trying to stay inside the arena whatever it is in outer space,0,569,5,5,174
it turned me completely around no i didnt want to go that way,0,818,8,8,198
alright,0,825,3,3,98
unintelligible im getting bonus points because im not going into hyperspace that much,0,804,6,6,297
and there is 10 so right now we need 2 within 250 i believe,0,848,3,3,245
pu and f well hyperspace is going to help me get a away,0,34,10,10,456
hyperspace,0,28,4,4,176
its frustrating i have to play with my left hand,0,658,6,6,54
theres a foe on the screen and is a,0,46,7,7,512
alright got up to 7 that time,0,558,6,6,50
what i did in one of the other games which was sacrifice control for points and speed,0,848,9,9,374
and then umm oh no i shot too fast no,0,130,2,2,251
just blew up again just trying to stay within the fortress this time the speed is very fast,0,848,1,1,200
slow down,0,12,2,2,410
oops mumbles alright,0,319,2,2,43
alright,0,26,4,4,46
turn turn then go straight,0,28,2,2,75
p so i guess try to go as slowly as possible,0,432,2,2,112
so you always wanna be moving,0,468,9,9,205
slow down,0,28,6,6,258
i wasnt expecting to be using my left hand um cause im a righthanded person,0,53,1,1,11
need to slow down,0,28,8,8,343
you just have to slow down mumbles really fast,0,190,1,1,116
turn trying to get into a good path trying to get some shots down friendly mine approaching,0,319,2,2,37
im shooting the base as i move across from it and rotating and shooting at the same time,0,300,9,9,401
yea thats right,0,53,7,7,295
your ship wrapped the screen 34 times,0,54,7,7,405
stop,0,49,8,8,444
it keeps stuttering a little bit sometimes which doesnt affect the play all that much but is kind of jarring when youre moving really fast and then you hit a mine and then the whole screen freezes,0,818,6,6,132
yes alright,0,51,5,5,171
p alright lets do this,0,568,3,3,60
if i could even control it at all,0,404,1,1,40
its really hard to control this guy,0,47,2,2,21
move slowly,0,14,1,1,454
were gonna keep going to the right,0,818,8,8,202
the most important part is going slow,0,432,5,5,143
seems if i get too slow i get killed by the center immediately so i have to maintain some velocity,0,681,3,3,242
p thats something right,0,432,1,1,100
so im getting the hang of it now not just the hang of moving,0,214,7,7,333
now if i kind of go around the edge of the screen its a lot easier and a lot more time umm im still worried about points,0,404,5,5,186
so most of my points are control cause this ship only shoots one way,0,130,9,9,397
3 4 come on zach alright im going a little fast,0,685,8,8,171
mumbles okay so that im always facing the hexagon,0,57,7,7,1257
your ship wrapped the screen 42 times,0,53,6,6,289
this round has been a lot easier with control unfortunately speed is still a problem i havent been able to find the right speed that the game prefers to add points,0,848,5,5,281
5 vulnerability 6 try to shoot it about once every time i wrap the screen,0,404,7,7,269
slowly shooting it not really paying attention to mumbles from the hexagon,0,300,10,10,422
alright one dollar sign waiting for the next,0,20,4,4,539
turn turn turn,0,127,8,8,260
dang man i be movin too fast for me to shoot this thing,0,16,3,3,220
its not hitting the space station,0,804,8,8,360
ah no trying to stay inside the hexagon,0,468,5,5,78
y okay thats a foe alright,0,473,1,1,169
my control is going up,0,54,5,5,324
ok so i feel like im just turning the ship and i dont know how to actually um like move it forward,0,468,1,1,7
well try to move around more often,0,54,10,10,451
alright that motherfworder coming for me,0,16,10,10,756
bo and e so i have to right click then kill that,0,52,10,10,867
holding down the clockwise thing makes me go slower,0,52,3,3,577
but at least i can stay within the hexagon a little better,0,57,7,7,1309
no no no turn,0,818,9,9,232
got it oh man this is the second part of the hyperspace yep got it,0,818,4,4,77
dang i just dont be moving way quick enough,0,16,4,4,290
oh fly this way,0,20,5,5,569
trying to control the ship first,0,300,1,1,214
velocity is a little too high,0,848,9,9,381
i must have went too fast or didnt react fast enough,0,12,9,9,653
alright my dog ej,0,16,3,3,187
literally flight path is impossible maybe itll be easier with joystick,0,20,4,4,534
im just gonna oh i can alright,0,28,5,5,222
oh i tried to slow down by pressing the stick backwards,0,411,6,6,91
slow down,0,51,6,6,195
come on slow down,0,127,10,10,285
just gonna keep going to the right same thing ive been doing trying not to fail taking out the mines doing pretty bad pretty bad,0,818,9,9,237
the hardest part i think as well is not wrapping around the screen because it makes it easier but you lose points by doing that,0,685,2,2,41
how fast they want it,0,16,9,9,743
oh crap just fly away fly away oh no,0,113,9,9,514
ah come on i had 2 shots left to kill it and i died thats not cool,0,685,8,8,166
its got 2 right away from the fortress,0,46,5,5,461
alright h,0,16,3,3,192
alright 4 probably gonna screen wrap 100 times here,0,404,7,7,260
okay going too fast,0,12,4,4,495
stop hitting the thing,0,24,6,6,129
ill get some bonus right now nice,0,20,2,2,461
slower slower,0,56,1,1,7
oh its so hard to focus on the bonus and control the ship,0,214,2,2,234
the mines i completely forgot about them ive been trying to just get the controls down,0,658,2,2,25
oh losing control here,0,788,9,9,178
still in hyperspace looking at all these planets,0,57,3,3,988
alright thats the second one down,0,825,6,6,193
three on the vulnerability counter i bounced off the octagon and the game is over,0,41,2,2,375
p kyx no stop stop flying,0,210,4,4,39
slow down again slow down slow down that one mine really kinda messed me up here,0,41,5,5,457
move a little forward a little bit,0,28,1,1,32
alright a youre friendly and youre gone,0,825,6,6,187
okay i see how i gotta move,0,16,2,2,131
alright and one two oh i missed and died before it,0,825,5,5,172
alright aim and fire thats 6 starting to get better at this,0,825,2,2,70
lose control of the ship,0,432,3,3,124
p ah jeez slow down slow down,0,50,5,5,52
thats not the alright,0,28,1,1,50
unfortunately i did not click right trigger twice fast enough,0,848,4,4,262
and theres a dime whatever slow down slow down,0,569,5,5,179
stop,0,411,6,6,93
so fast,0,647,10,10,245
im just going to stay right here and start shooting him,0,113,1,1,266
oh thats right ok,0,211,4,4,59
make a left,0,20,7,7,651
i think i hot too fast,0,12,1,1,359
i dotn always go so slow,0,52,1,1,519
uh thats friendly but i cannot slow down enough to shoot it,0,3,5,5,80
okay were at 5 right now,0,34,5,5,241
i slowed too soon,0,29,4,4,427
getting it under control is the hardest thing,0,211,2,2,32
alright slow down,0,16,4,4,305
moving too fast,0,12,4,4,479
move forward,0,28,2,2,79
cant waste this turn man i gotta learn how to move,0,16,8,8,676
oh because i need to back into the hexagon,0,54,5,5,325
turn turn turn,0,127,10,10,290
woah this is so hard to control,0,51,1,1,6
straight right straight right straight left left left left,0,20,7,7,660
slow down and turn and move,0,28,10,10,428
slow down,0,53,3,3,119
gotta slow down,0,41,6,6,492
rotating at a 90 degree angle,0,300,5,5,305
its a lot faster than i wanted,0,788,1,1,61
so i need to click faster next time between the 2,0,468,6,6,124
for some reason velocity very very bad,0,29,5,5,481
moving a little bit too fast,0,14,5,5,605
i think thats always important in a game you gotta learn how to move first,0,214,8,8,353
stop shooting me,0,54,9,9,438
im slowly moving strait towards the fortress and now im dead,0,14,5,5,608
i wish i ciuld get it slower,0,52,9,9,820
have to stay ok i gotta go slow thats my problem im going to fast,0,52,1,1,497
going too fast,0,319,9,9,223
no slow down,0,28,3,3,137
then were gonna go back into this hexagon,0,54,8,8,421
alright i got it going here im at 5,0,848,2,2,219
p the only thing is wrapping the screen i just cant really avoid it its one or the other if i cant control it then,0,404,4,4,122
so i move so quickly though,0,57,10,10,1491
i should really stop starting to turn to try and get a cheap shot because im not going to turn fast enough to get a cheap shot,0,825,4,4,135
your ship wrapped the screen twentyfive times,0,57,9,9,1448
i can like just mmm mumbles alright stop moving,0,568,2,2,49
all right all right,0,57,2,2,948
alright i got my strategy,0,33,5,5,731
i think the best strategy ive figured out is just let it thrust one way and then just float and try not to get hit while you shoot the fortress,0,685,2,2,34
p i went to hyper space,0,55,8,8,925
theres a lot of divided attention going on its pretty intense and i cannot stay in this hexagon,0,190,2,2,133
really slowed down,0,41,4,4,442
26 shots left,0,26,3,3,31
too fast too fast too fast,0,14,2,2,484
alright percent cant use that,0,454,5,5,199
hopefully itll offset some of the 1000 because im flying in circles,0,468,4,4,59
p slow down slow down,0,50,4,4,48
come on turn and shoot turn and shoot turn and shoot,0,16,8,8,643
gonna get back inside gotta get back inside the hexagon,0,300,1,1,204
okay so right now friend okay,0,34,1,1,22
once it starts going fast its really hard to,0,404,10,10,380
trying to go clockwise,0,647,1,1,125
im getting my timing right in between the shots so the counter doesnt reset,0,681,4,4,260
that was off real off oops back to the optimal method of losing control of my ship,0,818,5,5,83
turn,0,56,1,1,12
p im doing better at staying in the hexagon well i was doing better at staying in the hexagon,0,45,7,7,76
okay gonna see if i can start rotating again and avoid that mine,0,300,2,2,233
you know i think im playing under the assumption that i cant go counterclockwise yeah that i have to go clockwise,0,214,7,7,339
aright shot,0,16,3,3,189
alright i think i did better this time around,0,568,2,2,50
i dont know if that was friendly or not i gotta watch the bottom to try to control the thing,0,113,1,1,255
p the foe mines are phf that means i have to if its a foe i have to turn it into a friendly mine in order to kill it so if its phf i have to double right click phf double right click,0,52,7,7,743
alright,0,16,2,2,172
get my moving down get my moving down,0,16,1,1,67
alright,0,127,1,1,129
i am going way to fast and it is tough right now,0,34,1,1,46
controlling the spaceship is the hardest thing here,0,28,1,1,51
how are you supposed to go in a circle and shoot,0,739,7,7,73
im really just going for control almost,0,404,5,5,187
alright yeah thats one dollar sign that ive seen at least,0,33,3,3,669
p okay i keep losing control almost immediately and i am having a lot of trouble slowing down,0,558,4,4,19
i have lost track of the money right now,0,34,2,2,88
all right,0,55,5,5,739
now im flying too fast,0,3,8,8,165
i am trying to slow down,0,53,9,9,427
well i got the interval right but i could not hit it,0,804,10,10,408
that was evenly faster,0,12,9,9,661
going back to the hexagon,0,300,6,6,330
slow down slow down,0,127,10,10,284
slow down,0,131,2,2,46
right now i have 1000 which i think is just fantastic,0,558,1,1,5
im going a bit slower,0,300,1,1,212
okay hit thei have terrible movement,0,468,9,9,202
alrighty,0,647,1,1,113
alright just a bonus once dollar sign pops up again got it alright points bonus,0,404,9,9,357
alright im getting a little bit better,0,190,1,1,110
i gotta get my muscle memory down as soon as i seen it to get the interval right,0,681,3,3,244
i always hate this  all right that didnt work,0,804,5,5,283
i have to learn to fly this thing before i can get the other functions down because its so difficult like those missiles,0,127,9,9,265
alright get out the way,0,16,4,4,325
okay so doing good on velocity,0,34,9,9,434
rotate rotating to aim,0,300,8,8,380
stop,0,43,10,10,199
alright so that was wow,0,113,3,3,328
ah alright so if i boom boom boom,0,20,4,4,517
i fly so okay there you go,0,214,4,4,278
im going to preserve my bullets and try to at least alright i got more bullets so im good for a little bit,0,685,4,4,90
no no stop,0,818,8,8,194
im controlling it,0,818,10,10,272
slow down,0,51,8,8,314
slow down slow down,0,28,1,1,24
turn and thrust turn and thrust,0,53,10,10,479
okay not doing too hot on this one on velocity or anything either,0,34,10,10,477
p ugh i shot it too fast because of the mine,0,400,9,9,134
going too slow,0,319,8,8,197
shot way to fast couldve gotten it,0,34,4,4,212
wsg alright so friend,0,473,2,2,181
do i just press spacebar to continue,0,30,1,1,53
my intervals are too fast for the mine however its vulnerability is getting higher im going really fast,0,130,10,10,421
out of control,0,319,5,5,126
yeah i think i forfeited staying in that um hexagon so now its just a game all about timing and accuracy to hopefully destroy one of these,0,825,4,4,137
p oh ok alright,0,404,7,7,274
okay screen just went black,0,34,1,1,50
im trying to slow this spaceship down cuz its going too fast,0,130,2,2,246
there okay now i can move,0,16,2,2,135
all right i dont even know how to memorize that,0,57,9,9,1389
okay now im movin way too fast,0,16,2,2,168
w ok managed to hit that enemy ok this is kind of just the grind right here,0,404,7,7,267
mumbles going too fast,0,319,3,3,58
mumbles clockwise mumbles alright,0,26,7,7,114
i just turned my friend into a foe,0,49,4,4,369
this thing move quick,0,16,1,1,14
points control,0,54,7,7,399
i think i clicked too fast,0,130,2,2,249
turn toward,0,28,7,7,290
turn the direction if i go the other way,0,52,2,2,550
alright do i just go on to the next one,0,51,1,1,20
alright my aim is terrible,0,190,2,2,132
you just can like go in a circle,0,51,4,4,107
alright,0,28,8,8,347
i was so close to shooting it i had 10 vulnerability so just trying to circle around clockwise oh no i couldve killed it twice,0,130,8,8,394
alright that is a c so that is a friendly,0,910,2,2,42
alright,0,28,4,4,177
like the way it changes directions thats exactly what you need to keep your ship in control,0,214,5,5,298
whoever is controlling this fortress needs to take a day off,0,41,10,10,639
alright,0,16,3,3,212
man i feel like in drifting right now man,0,16,3,3,251
mumbles clockwise,0,26,6,6,99
slow down,0,51,4,4,96
486 right hand,0,52,5,5,654
going too fast,0,28,10,10,411
aright,0,54,7,7,383
too slow,0,24,4,4,93
turn and go,0,28,2,2,98
and im out of control,0,28,8,8,341
i just walked right into that one,0,155,7,7,262
getting used to the sensitivity but i completely expect that once the controls change it will be difficult all over again,0,12,3,3,451
um just getting a lot more control of my ship,0,404,4,4,143
see if i just screen wrap and kind of just stay in one horizontal err vertical line then that actually works pretty well for me,0,404,7,7,248
too fast,0,24,1,1,32
i think im getting worse because because its im not focusing staying in the bounds,0,57,4,4,1073
alright just uh huh,0,30,3,3,123
alright and go,0,28,1,1,10
i definitely feel more in control of the ship thing but it still feels like ice,0,217,9,9,75
im in totally control i have relaxed everything in my body for some reason im not morphing out of control,0,825,8,8,246
okay i gotta turn then move,0,16,6,6,497
slow down,0,569,9,9,233
i felt like im doing everything right,0,33,8,8,856
p im gonna stay in this hexagon,0,50,9,9,112
p alright,0,809,7,7,115
left arm is getting tired from muscle confusion,0,319,9,9,237
alright,0,16,1,1,34
trying to control my speed,0,319,4,4,88
its a lot faster paced than i thought it would be for sure,0,404,1,1,26
seem to keep going into hyperspace so jd thats a friend,0,34,3,3,138
umm alright so i got lucky that it was a friendly mine,0,404,1,1,20
you know when youre trying to slide your controller its just impossible to pay attention to anything else like youre just trying to like stay in the hexagon,0,214,4,4,279
stop,0,33,2,2,585
no stay out of hyperspace,0,818,7,7,164
yeah i think that my problem is that i prioritize it trying to stay on the screen so the mouse doesnt factor into this for me,0,47,3,3,34
controlling my ship,0,49,5,5,375
and turn shoot,0,28,8,8,346
okay going way too fast,0,818,5,5,111
p alright omv omv omv omv omv,0,910,2,2,27
and velocity is im at 500 500 points,0,41,1,1,312
come on slow down slow down,0,127,6,6,221
p alright,0,51,8,8,297
its like trying to go slow and steady now just messes you up,0,411,5,5,77
ah i ran into the friendly mine because i was moving too fast,0,3,7,7,130
alright i was going way too fast,0,190,2,2,138
this is extremely difficult i go very very fast,0,34,1,1,25
uh get on the screen,0,739,10,10,107
p alright,0,910,1,1,13
no dont dont dont lose control,0,818,8,8,210
alright two hand is not working so back to one,0,20,7,7,644
turn,0,210,6,6,73
okay what is this right now,0,34,3,3,132
this next screen im going to kill it 486 enter,0,52,8,8,783
p alright,0,473,4,4,219
oh that was too fast,0,28,9,9,378
what hyperspace meant,0,214,9,9,374
alright friendly mine,0,28,5,5,215
p alright,0,848,8,8,349
p and then i press the space bar afterwards,0,27,1,1,3
ok mumbling alright got a friendly on the screen take him down ok,0,404,9,9,356
i always see the dollar sign right when i have to shoot it,0,647,9,9,222
and theres a mine on the screen but its just blew up alright,0,848,5,5,282
four oh were moving now,0,20,4,4,530
just gonna do fly bys okay were gonna try to gain control and were gonna,0,818,4,4,78
oh and hes flying on his own again,0,20,2,2,425
alright thats one back,0,16,2,2,142
p slow down slow down,0,50,10,10,133
i tried to stay in the hexagon that time,0,468,4,4,50
alright damn,0,16,2,2,161
alright i gotta keep shooting im at vulnerability 3 thought i was higher damn,0,404,10,10,387
p trying to go around the circle,0,647,2,2,133
oh its faster now i can aim better though this way,0,211,6,6,86
ok this is the longest ive stayed in the circle so clearly im doing something right when i talk to myself aloud,0,20,7,7,662
thats too fast,0,12,6,6,558
alright that is a d,0,16,6,6,442
x thats a friendly mine going too fast going to fast,0,404,6,6,225
there we go slow down,0,51,8,8,317
im also getting better at unconsciously flying around and shooting this thing in the middle,0,681,4,4,259
alright go this way,0,51,3,3,58
move,0,20,10,10,809
alright,0,16,3,3,177
alright,0,647,10,10,234
i know the recommended strategy was go counterclockwise but if my ship starts going clockwise gonna try to go with it because its so hard to control,0,404,9,9,355
fly up,0,30,10,10,528
dangit i keep flying right into him,0,16,4,4,314
im just flying in space not doing anything right now,0,372,1,1,7
okay did it alrighty thats how you do it,0,41,4,4,420
turn and i died,0,28,6,6,278
yea i have to move faster,0,214,9,9,378
p the important thing about moving it is likedont overturn or overcorrect,0,432,4,4,133
points is left,0,16,2,2,93
slow down a little,0,685,8,8,172
umm especially with the mine coming at you faster and youre trying to avoid the bullets from the fortress as well,0,685,6,6,135
second dollar sign going too fast,0,319,8,8,193
make a right make a left go straight go straight,0,20,7,7,650
its spinning so fast,0,211,2,2,24
alright,0,28,1,1,44
just gotta alright,0,473,3,3,210
there needs to be a slow down button because this is ridiculous,0,113,5,5,381
shooting in a slow rate of fire,0,300,7,7,353
p so i need to turn that into a nope not good,0,52,2,2,547
mumbles alright,0,26,6,6,97
im adjusting flight for the fly by tactic again moving to that side,0,910,2,2,43
still getting used still trying to stay in the control area for the most part,0,404,1,1,30
move move,0,30,1,1,37
alright,0,127,2,2,162
alright get the points,0,51,10,10,453
ok thats a  no oh turn shoot,0,33,2,2,602
alright,0,647,5,5,174
move your way around ozi its an enemy bye,0,130,6,6,334
im supposed to be staying in the hexagon,0,20,3,3,509
i need to slow down,0,12,4,4,471
alright box,0,16,2,2,101
ah ok no but i get slower so i can usually avoid enemy mines,0,404,4,4,170
i went too fast,0,130,4,4,300
p okay oh this shoots fast this thing moves fast great,0,14,1,1,436
my velocity is great,0,41,7,7,539
alright,0,16,8,8,610
alright,0,41,8,8,575
all right we have dollar sign then we have w,0,55,7,7,823
alright,0,825,10,10,293
learn how to control it,0,33,1,1,539
g no nononono back forward back forward back forward there we go,0,14,8,8,769
p aright cool,0,49,1,1,281
p oh ok alright,0,404,1,1,7
gotta say this mumbles clockwise,0,28,6,6,253
stop it,0,113,2,2,298
slow down,0,51,3,3,74
alright im not even worrying about direction at this point,0,411,6,6,97
p im pressing 8 to move forward,0,300,1,1,197
oh theres a mine on screen i think its friendly,0,3,10,10,226
move,0,28,6,6,279
oh no i feel like i might lose sanity for a bit just briefly,0,825,3,3,110
alright im at 10 again but im flying all over and i died,0,558,7,7,56
turn around this way yes okay you bounced right off i thought you were going to die,0,818,2,2,32
spinning around this thing its all about if youre going in one direction you press the thrust key,0,804,9,9,385
alright im driftin lets get it,0,16,6,6,471
its kind of hard when im warping in and out of the screen i actually managed to hit it,0,404,5,5,183
there was a mine on the screen but that was taken care of,0,848,8,8,353
alright alright gotta slow down someh okay,0,28,1,1,18
slow down,0,51,8,8,303
phf double right click phf means its a foe so it has to be friendly double right click,0,52,7,7,744
1 2 3 got the bonus 4 5 6 6 7 8 9 10 alright now im at 440,0,372,8,8,101
thats not my i need to turn him into,0,52,7,7,768
alright,0,319,2,2,22
uh t ah man didnt get the right interval there that was the problem,0,404,4,4,148
alright,0,16,2,2,137
okay so i just move extremely quickly,0,34,1,1,12
g unfriendly ah im out of control ah man ok,0,404,10,10,379
wrapped around screen 25 times,0,658,2,2,24
shoot okay alright umm i think im starting to get a little better doing the thrusting and all that stuff trying to keep it on the screen a little bit better,0,685,1,1,18
p lki lki it goes too fast how i get back on track,0,569,1,1,111
first dollar sign going too fast,0,319,7,7,180
its hard to figure out how to slow down to turn around obviously i turn around and then,0,214,3,3,259
lets see the vulnerability is at 0 right now,0,300,1,1,210
i keep wanting to shoot really fast but,0,569,4,4,154
p gonna stay in the hexagon,0,50,7,7,72
move around a little bit,0,54,6,6,349
p alright here we go,0,113,1,1,238
slow down,0,53,2,2,69
gotta slow down,0,49,2,2,288
slow down,0,51,5,5,145
turn turn turn,0,127,3,3,169
alright still getting killed by the enemy mines all the time they come on the screen pretty fast so i have to look immediately down,0,681,2,2,231
was that not fast enough,0,16,9,9,742
p alright just gonna gonna take all the shots,0,190,4,4,174
alright o thats a friendly,0,404,10,10,386
alright,0,16,1,1,24
ok managing to stay in the control zone,0,404,9,9,350
p and i have no idea how to slow down,0,57,1,1,827
alright i got to make sure to quickly press fire button to destroy the base,0,300,10,10,414
y i dont remember i dont remember he number right now,0,34,7,7,346
damn i got no control over these,0,49,2,2,323
okay if i hit the fortress i go backward which is not even a bad strategy at all,0,52,3,3,575
ok take it slowly there you go nope come back,0,210,5,5,51
alright so how im onna do this,0,16,3,3,258
just trying to slow down and shoot this,0,130,8,8,387
lemmy slow down,0,16,1,1,17
okay go forward do that,0,818,2,2,29
your ship wrapped the screen 40 times,0,51,3,3,84
umm alright,0,28,10,10,448
alright i think i did worse,0,190,3,3,167
oh i just did a full hexagon no i didnt no i didnt,0,52,6,6,735
slow down,0,51,7,7,278
i get points deducted every time i go into hyperspace but it might be a move,0,53,8,8,365
okay so move this thing here,0,57,8,8,1330
alright,0,54,5,5,337
not many people unintelligible feel like my biggest issue is controlling the ship since the ship doesnt stop at all,0,804,5,5,291
slow down,0,56,7,7,100
im going to try turning a little bit of speed,0,51,2,2,37
bounce off the space fortress dude,0,40,2,2,53
i should just be a hyperspace pilot,0,53,3,3,124
still trying to gain control its a really difficult game you werent kidding 4 thats a friendly mine,0,41,2,2,368
slow down,0,127,6,6,224
its much harder to dodge the missiles when youre inside the hexagon,0,400,3,3,70
its a foe no too slow,0,34,1,1,43
i thought i was getting good at flying,0,20,3,3,497
p ok i cant seem to control myself,0,809,1,1,16
your ship warped through the screen 29 times,0,825,1,1,42
i need to stop going into hyperspace,0,53,6,6,275
already moving too quickly,0,14,4,4,558
trying to shoot and stay clockwise,0,468,7,7,141
oh get back on the screen,0,739,5,5,53
that velocity scored points are like nothing cause i keep dying,0,12,1,1,373
its alright well get it and well get it,0,53,4,4,181
alright take my points and double shot,0,30,8,8,433
i can see why theyd give you points for going slow because it makes it significantly easier,0,400,7,7,118
out of control out of control out of control,0,319,9,9,236
alright,0,28,4,4,170
okay i only have 1 shot left okay 50,0,29,7,7,544
lets see im gonna start shooting at trying to form a square path instead of a hexagon path,0,300,5,5,303
get back in control,0,319,10,10,257
like a lot these controls dont do very much,0,809,2,2,38
boy these things are flying,0,127,1,1,128
alright lemmy learn how to move while i okay,0,16,8,8,673
p im at the top of the hexagon fire a few shots,0,300,9,9,386
im going to try and move slower this time while dodging missiles so get more points,0,400,4,4,82
its like the game knows when youre doing well and it just fires a thingy right at you,0,53,4,4,165
go turn forward,0,28,6,6,239
so im supposed to point at them and hit the right mouse button,0,658,2,2,27
slowly move around,0,14,5,5,626
its very instinctual to press the key as fast as you can and thats not what youre supposed to do,0,12,4,4,498
i wrote the flight path that i wanted to do but this is not working,0,20,1,1,410
9 i got 1 more then i gotta start going for the control shot,0,404,7,7,263
gotta control this spaceship,0,647,7,7,203
i want to move because its hard to control while im shooting but the thing keeps shooting at me,0,54,3,3,220
get control,0,319,4,4,101
i got 800 velocity i gotta slow down,0,569,1,1,119
kay slow down,0,51,10,10,434
can i go forward,0,55,1,1,548
p alright im trying to go in the counterclockwise flight path im like having trouble turning it,0,45,1,1,4
alright,0,28,5,5,206
and right before i had it again,0,818,9,9,235
i dont wanna be going this fast,0,14,4,4,548
stops game,0,739,1,1,5
slower and clockwise,0,28,8,8,350
i feel like going slow works the best,0,739,3,3,35
mumbles umm so thats the first dollar sign and thats an enemy mine umm second dollar sign so just trying to stop my acceleration cuz its going too fast,0,130,1,1,230
very hard to control,0,12,8,8,617
p its more harder if you try to stay inside the hexagon,0,658,5,5,39
this is very hard to control,0,29,6,6,502
okay so my control was terrible,0,34,4,4,213
velocity is still too high slow down a tad,0,848,9,9,383
wrapped the screen way too many times,0,319,7,7,187
turn stay,0,20,1,1,409
alright lemmy go my other way,0,16,7,7,537
the plan currently is to try and stay within the fortress as best as possible because the control points are very high,0,848,10,10,407
ok so just moving up and down helps a little,0,411,9,9,131
negative 813 ship was damaged 13 times i was damaged twice by the mines and i screen warped 28 times,0,825,3,3,124
i cant control myself,0,16,3,3,252
slow down,0,51,2,2,24
and i dont know how much times left,0,685,10,10,225
stop stop stop stop stop,0,53,10,10,476
hyperspace,0,818,5,5,108
forward,0,53,10,10,462
were just going to keep going to the right,0,818,5,5,87
i know how to move,0,16,1,1,49
stop running into the tower,0,24,7,7,166
alright its getting a little easier now,0,685,7,7,153
flying towardsthere you go i couldnt even see if it was an ally or not,0,130,8,8,381
alright i definitely just definitely energized that,0,404,1,1,34
the control is real touchy i gotta get used to it,0,681,1,1,189
stop stop,0,411,8,8,115
moving too fast moving too fast moving too fast moving too fast,0,14,4,4,560
dont wrap the screen,0,51,6,6,191
i wont feel right if i dont,0,49,7,7,401
lets see if i can control this thing try to stay in no stay in,0,29,6,6,500
and theres another and im trying to slow down to get inside the thing,0,569,6,6,191
alright this was by far my best run im in the 3000s,0,468,4,4,65
no that was left alright,0,20,7,7,681
p so im trying to go through the circle,0,647,1,1,110
alright this game is impossible,0,20,2,2,441
i cant control it this is really hard to control,0,33,1,1,545
too fast too fast too fast,0,14,4,4,579
im just going in and out of warp zone right now,0,404,3,3,91
p just trying to get the controls down,0,658,4,4,35
no cant control,0,29,3,3,394
uninterpretable yeah if i managed to find a way to control the ship maybe i can do better,0,29,8,8,568
alright this is very sensitive,0,28,2,2,96
vulnerability is at 10 but there was a mine on screen,0,46,8,8,547
so thats an ally mine just trying to move around this hexagon for more control points,0,130,4,4,296
alright,0,20,6,6,601
at least i destroyed it its not fast this is good,0,211,9,9,125
p im trying to get back into the hexagon,0,45,8,8,83
alright vulnerability 2 and he hit me thats enough,0,818,8,8,208
come on stop choking,0,24,8,8,196
stop being so fast,0,54,8,8,422
alright,0,30,2,2,106
okay ill just fly around i guess,0,12,2,2,397
alright thats one,0,16,9,9,722
velocity 42,0,54,5,5,336
im flying counter clockwise im trying to,0,372,1,1,9
alright i just destroyed the fortress so that strategy seems to work,0,372,5,5,64
b alright you my friend,0,16,2,2,144
circles will not get me wins,0,30,5,5,257
alright lets do this,0,319,6,6,141
alright back to zero,0,16,5,5,356
going too fast,0,46,2,2,392
p oh man i was only 4000 points alright,0,558,1,1,7
ok we are going to move slow like this,0,52,2,2,540
nice and slow,0,41,5,5,465
alright,0,28,4,4,165
alright perfect so i think we got the right velocity going,0,848,9,9,384
the mines mumbling cause i couldnt get the ship controlled to save my life,0,804,7,7,327
p okay uhm so i cant slow down,0,50,1,1,3
this is so hard to control,0,131,3,3,65
still cant control this thing,0,26,4,4,52
let me keep moving to escape,0,34,2,2,98
little circles,0,51,6,6,208
alright alright,0,28,2,2,71
i intended to avoid spardic flight pattens,0,12,6,6,551
okay trying to do a counterclockwise thing here,0,41,1,1,322
go forward no forward,0,33,1,1,550
ok uh no ran right into me,0,33,3,3,654
alright that was all ten,0,30,10,10,585
i do not want to be going that fast,0,818,2,2,30
p k g y right,0,50,6,6,66
i must control my movement,0,468,9,9,207
getting out of control first time i see the dollar sign friendly mine also on the screen,0,319,6,6,145
it flies too fast,0,20,6,6,607
slow down going way to fast,0,34,4,4,203
thats confusing how he moves,0,52,1,1,491
esp esp trying to focus on the spaceship while doing the intervals its tough but thats an ally mine luckily,0,130,8,8,377
p i really need to learn to play left handed,0,658,8,8,61
seriously who controlled this,0,41,1,1,309
and im going faster,0,411,6,6,98
alright well just r,0,16,3,3,240
im waiting for the 250 millisecond interval and nothing alright,0,20,4,4,549
especially the maneuverability of it and the dexterity i mean for the to control the spaceship here,0,127,7,7,240
alright slow down,0,16,1,1,19
yeah another im going in circles outside of the lines,0,468,6,6,126
i cant control this is killing me,0,404,1,1,39
hyperspace someone is following me,0,468,8,8,187
i shot too fast that time i can tell,0,12,2,2,392
turn around bang,0,20,8,8,721
please slow down,0,825,4,4,144
who says you need to go in circles to win,0,30,4,4,183
wrong rotation wrong rotation,0,14,5,5,600
alright lets go,0,685,3,3,46
the iff button is the right button but i clicked the left button,0,468,6,6,114
im going to start shooting the fortress slower,0,300,6,6,327
i think its smarter to stay on the outside i feel like im losing more points getting shot than control,0,400,3,3,69
thats a friendly mine but im moving really fast so i dont know if i can shoot it,0,3,7,7,122
so now im consistently shooting the fortress being able to kill it getting used to the ships control more getting used to flying around in a frictionless environment and compensating on the turns,0,681,1,1,218
apparently that friend was a foe so im just gonna keep going into hyperspace apparently since i cant just stay straight,0,804,10,10,406
i got the interval right but i didnt shoot it,0,24,3,3,87
yep fly right into it,0,30,6,6,318
p i feel like its not worth getting the bonuses because i float off so fast,0,18,5,5,36
i cant slow it down come on,0,127,5,5,209
alright beef,0,16,7,7,509
its a lot faster than i thought it was going to,0,647,1,1,111
i hit the left mouse button instead of the right,0,319,3,3,66
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,4,4,310
lets stop lets stop,0,34,8,8,380
inaudible going way too fast but im outside the game ended,0,3,5,5,93
okay thats a foe but my interval wasnt fast enough and bonus,0,49,4,4,360
2 dollar signs bonus points i think that was an enemy mine but he was coming right at me,0,24,6,6,137
well the screen went black,0,33,1,1,577
okay wow were at 7 right now,0,34,5,5,252
alright,0,28,8,8,349
moving slow across from it,0,300,9,9,402
these shots are not controlled at all,0,113,9,9,507
i think im out of control here,0,468,7,7,158
ah interval or speed for my click was too fast and i died,0,685,3,3,62
problem is i just have such a hard time controlling this thing that its hard for me to do anything with it,0,127,7,7,233
go to the left stop it oh wow i ran into that one,0,113,2,2,301
ok i destroyed 1ok much better and im ging slower,0,569,9,9,227
alright,0,49,2,2,308
p alright bonus,0,51,10,10,396
alright theres the bonus 1 bonus 2 for the points,0,404,10,10,385
hmm not fast enough nope,0,568,2,2,47
alright the only way im going to win this is if i have the mine on my side,0,20,4,4,543
i seem to be losing a lot of control points,0,34,5,5,250
that doesnt stop moving,0,20,1,1,393
slow again,0,300,4,4,273
p yes thats what im trying to concentrate on right now,0,432,3,3,125
its very hard to get any control points or velocity points,0,12,1,1,365
turn,0,28,1,1,28
alright,0,16,7,7,575
now im gonna start focusing on i guess that well staying in the control zone,0,404,10,10,368
slow down,0,27,6,6,113
so yeah just trying to understand the movement and get the muscle memory down because it might take some time,0,468,3,3,42
so i got one more hit left,0,34,6,6,313
okay no stop stop moving,0,113,5,5,378
okay gained some control there we go,0,818,6,6,129
im started to go too fast at that,0,12,8,8,616
going too fast i see the dollar sign and an enemy mine,0,319,7,7,168
ok ok ok i got it under control now,0,155,6,6,236
alright im only on the ten point,0,16,8,8,656
alright this is way more,0,825,1,1,4
all right thats an enemy mine,0,55,7,7,811
turn,0,28,6,6,271
no stop leaving the screen,0,113,2,2,286
okay its really difficult to speak and talk at the same time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 i guess i guess it shoots you quickly you slow down,0,41,7,7,528
i can slow down when i get killed but id prefer to do that differently,0,569,5,5,176
okay vulnerability is at 0 which is bad cuz i get a turn on this,0,29,6,6,497
alright,0,28,1,1,19
stop corning me,0,113,3,3,318
its honestly its better to just stay still because of all of these points im losing from the hexagon,0,54,4,4,257
just stay in the circle,0,51,4,4,103
turn turn turn,0,127,2,2,149
run forward,0,30,8,8,443
im really just trying to get this thing to like allow me to control it but were not friends right now,0,47,1,1,8
i gotta build up the vulnerability counter and try to move clockwise,0,681,1,1,194
its not staying on the lines right now,0,46,1,1,362
yep dont even know where clockwise is now,0,57,3,3,968
p oh friend or foe mouse right counterclockwise got it,0,53,2,2,39
p slow down,0,50,4,4,46
alright here we go,0,28,6,6,248
alright where the next motherfworder at,0,16,7,7,580
aww now its real fast oh crap,0,211,7,7,92
p lyv this is whether or not a mine is a foe so if it shows up on the iff counter at the bottom of the screen i have to if its one of those letters then it is a foe,0,681,1,1,188
going into hyperspace,0,468,9,9,198
all right full game,0,57,4,4,1037
but due to my incredible maneuvering i cannot seem to line up a shot and the one time i do i seem to click it too rapidly which resets the vulnerability score so it is very frustrating,0,558,2,2,12
my left hand cant respond to nothin,0,16,4,4,293
so its a little faster than that the right click,0,24,2,2,67
p yeah this thing is moving so fast its hard to pay attention to the mines and dollar signs but i know i should,0,211,2,2,33
and just went to hyper space,0,14,7,7,720
octagon,0,41,1,1,336
i pressed space bar by accident,0,113,1,1,246
i think i had positive control points so pretty excited about that,0,558,7,7,58
oh im still like flying around,0,214,2,2,213
alright okay okay,0,28,5,5,200
i was gonna fly strait at it,0,14,8,8,770
aright,0,16,8,8,650
thats weird i didnt notice the fortress was spinning within the octagon or hexagon whatever,0,211,5,5,69
ok now start trying to control a little bit more,0,404,8,8,306
uhh alright,0,825,4,4,151
oh no wait oh the mine is on the screen,0,190,1,1,113
its crazy alright,0,113,2,2,308
alright so bouncing off the middle seems to send me in the opposite direction so its not a good way to slow me down,0,468,8,8,178
the whole having to move forward to move yoursledf back is a lot to manage,0,400,4,4,88
turn turn,0,210,4,4,46
i got the right interval and was able to shoot it to get another vulnerability point on the  oh i did horrible,0,848,9,9,393
alright,0,818,5,5,106
slowing down im staying better now,0,300,3,3,258
too fast slow down,0,300,3,3,252
alright so,0,568,1,1,8
p yeah do i press space bar,0,568,1,1,29
go straight make a left,0,20,7,7,655
sorry didnt fly it,0,53,2,2,50
i think oh didnt happen this time alright,0,558,3,3,16
alright,0,28,5,5,228
alright so i need to stay within the hexagon,0,52,1,1,488
going too fast,0,319,6,6,150
getting a little more control but unintelligible im not going to be doing so hot,0,804,6,6,306
alright i might as well just use my shit,0,16,4,4,296
turn,0,28,4,4,189
i think the next time i play this game its going to switch the controls on me,0,53,1,1,32
im too strong with the thrust,0,16,9,9,693
alright thats it,0,16,8,8,635
too fast aww i got to pay attention to that,0,211,6,6,81
p so this is nothing right here txh,0,26,1,1,3
oh alright so the hardest thing is not making any huge movements,0,319,2,2,19
p im going to go over the instructions so i have 2 left click when i see the dollar sign right click when i see the number,0,52,10,10,851
oooh slow down slow down slow down,0,127,6,6,219
so fast oh,0,211,7,7,100
i was going to slow mumbles,0,404,10,10,382
lemmy try to slow this down,0,29,2,2,363
alright i have control now,0,825,8,8,245
just get into the hexagon,0,28,1,1,39
p ok i cannot play this game right its kind of embarrassing,0,411,2,2,28
fly up and oh thats the ending,0,30,6,6,320
p alright,0,454,4,4,191
l alright you my dog,0,16,8,8,641
alright,0,404,5,5,177
p alright i got one more shot,0,16,10,10,754
alright well destroyed the fortress once time,0,404,8,8,327
ok hes at 10 now ah man alright if i could just not mess this up i can actually manage to,0,404,5,5,189
slow oh alright,0,30,3,3,143
alright so now we have this game plan set up,0,848,9,9,388
i cant get a control of it,0,210,1,1,5
its kind of hard to keep out of hyperspace but oh the boss got me,0,804,2,2,247
but if i move too fast ill lose control,0,404,1,1,42
right we got some type of points,0,57,9,9,1403
okay well velocity isnt doing too bad just the points right now which is,0,34,7,7,351
alright this oh oh,0,20,4,4,513
i didnt expect it to have all this moving stuff,0,217,1,1,35
p yeah like sometimes its like harder to move around i dont think its the controls,0,211,6,6,84
oh this is really alright,0,568,1,1,6
turning,0,28,6,6,242
slow down,0,51,7,7,235
alright,0,28,1,1,34
okay there we go alright lets go,0,685,5,5,111
difficulty staying in the hexagon,0,432,2,2,114
pit stopped,0,40,1,1,47
um just flying it not really changing anything,0,33,6,6,763
uhh yeah okay so same controls,0,53,4,4,142
alright,0,16,2,2,141
i m choosing not to shoot right now because i dont have any bullets and i dont want to take negative points as im already doing,0,685,4,4,88
slowing down,0,300,5,5,313
oh i couldve gotten it no it was b so i had to turn it into a,0,52,5,5,666
so i want to turn him into a friendy,0,52,1,1,523
slowed down too much,0,3,6,6,112
alright,0,404,2,2,72
slowing down is extremely  difficult so its better to go at an optimal speed constantly or just very slow constatntly,0,12,2,2,398
ok so not going clockwise but im gonna try to stay in the middle kinda not go to hyperspace like the last few rounds,0,468,6,6,133
alright but i didnt get hit as much,0,16,4,4,341
turn and no,0,28,7,7,301
alright best score yet,0,558,7,7,57
p when theres nothing in the screen i can fore at the fortress,0,52,8,8,782
theres no slowing down,0,49,1,1,254
p i like how fast this game is,0,432,1,1,101
all right,0,55,4,4,659
my turning will never start off strong,0,16,7,7,514
and we have 14 left,0,848,6,6,324
sometimes its like harder for me to move it,0,211,6,6,83
alright there we go,0,51,4,4,93
turn around,0,55,3,3,627
p but i feel like im starting to get the hang of it a little bit except that the joystick is very sensitive so i keep flying all over the place,0,45,1,1,7
umm its still i think the hardest thing is identifying the bonuses cuz you have so much on the screen,0,685,7,7,159
alright,0,16,1,1,44
mine on the screen k,0,55,6,6,785
its not fair it just gets you right when you start,0,473,3,3,202
tba that means i have to turn it,0,52,6,6,714
one bonus achieved still getting used to the controls since the ship does not slow down,0,804,3,3,259
im trying to not be crazy all over the screen for once,0,569,4,4,151
um i stay outside the control zone,0,404,4,4,169
alright try to keep going in a counterclockwise shape,0,28,3,3,125
too slowly there,0,404,7,7,250
alright he got me,0,190,3,3,159
trying to slow myself down before i shoot,0,300,9,9,394
total score is 3890 and wrapped the screen 57 times,0,52,1,1,524
alright lets ride,0,16,9,9,731
alright,0,54,6,6,365
alright lets do this,0,319,8,8,192
strategy of just flying randomly,0,30,3,3,139
dang my left hand cant respond for shit,0,16,8,8,661
all right there,0,55,5,5,723
i feel like its not the best strategy because every time i go off the screen its 75 on the control but i thought i would get points better that way but it has not been working out quite,0,848,2,2,223
its hard to control this the same way you control a space ship,0,647,6,6,188
every time i warp my control gets worse,0,33,4,4,679
i am tired of your mess this is annoying you are annoying you are annoying you little backwards e,0,113,7,7,454
alright i think thats the second dollar sign,0,473,6,6,288
so close slow down,0,825,4,4,143
alrighty continue,0,41,2,2,378
alright get outta here,0,16,2,2,154
p slow down,0,50,9,9,111
i shouldve mumbles wrapped around the screen thirtyfour times,0,55,2,2,616
definitely the controls though pretty simple game overall,0,818,3,3,37
ok trying to stay back in control,0,404,4,4,164
so right now im just trying to shoot at it,0,130,2,2,253
p its hard to move,0,211,2,2,19
alright i got it,0,454,2,2,162
it is so hard to stay in bounds,0,16,1,1,54
okay alright the flight is getting a little better,0,113,6,6,414
i just go backwards or left to right i dont know,0,211,7,7,103
alright this a a,0,16,3,3,230
yeah its real easy to spin out of control,0,400,5,5,102
gonna wrap around im going too fast too fast too fast enemy mine,0,319,3,3,57
come on turn turn turn,0,127,8,8,256
turn,0,28,3,3,141
too fast,0,12,6,6,563
whoa too fast,0,788,3,3,85
p oh it said it right there so,0,33,1,1,569
i can just keep this going so what im doing now is just sliding on the screen taking advantage of the little to no friction on the ground and then it appears the fortress cannot shoot me,0,848,2,2,217
i dont care if i keep going into hyperspace i just need to get this vulnerability,0,34,3,3,147
ok thats off to a bad start already slow it down,0,468,7,7,146
im circling,0,468,8,8,182
alright this is a lot harder than i thought it would be,0,28,1,1,45
nice and slow 6 7 8 wait thats a good mine k bonus points,0,41,10,10,621
i dint see the interval i think it was too fast,0,24,8,8,176
p this thing is fast,0,40,1,1,46
p im trying to go slow and clockwise,0,50,1,1,9
oh i gotta slow down,0,34,2,2,65
oh right click bonus points,0,52,4,4,637
just stay slow,0,28,4,4,168
oh no thats clockwise,0,57,5,5,1127
trying to stay in control mumbles,0,809,6,6,101
it feels like if you go off the screen it makes you real faster,0,513,2,2,40
i have 4 shot left,0,41,3,3,399
p alright,0,404,8,8,281
im having a hard time controlling the ship,0,809,1,1,15
umm that hyperspace word makes me want to watch that movie with owen wilson,0,53,3,3,125
aright um just going to come her and shoot for now,0,54,6,6,351
youre a friend yay i guess right,0,113,8,8,476
turn and move,0,28,10,10,417
alright,0,24,3,3,85
now im losing control velocity isnt doing to bad,0,34,7,7,359
alright,0,54,8,8,430
gotts stick and move stick and move,0,16,5,5,432
im out of control i see a dollar sign its the first time though second time,0,319,5,5,117
too fast,0,131,2,2,49
alright now lets try shooting at some stuff,0,28,1,1,38
alright ill try to at least destroy the fortress at least once if i hit it,0,804,4,4,272
i just realized that i have 15 shots alright then,0,558,8,8,62
moving forward again vulnerability is still at 0,0,300,3,3,248
you can only focus on one thing either destroying the mine or the fortress and then theres things shooting at you and then you have to think about not going into hyperdrive or hyperspace and the points and i dont even look at the points at times,0,53,7,7,310
enemy mine going way too fast,0,319,5,5,124
ive been getting the most points for control really,0,12,5,5,536
its so risky to slow down,0,12,2,2,406
especially i think the hardest thing for me right now is figuring out what to like after i gain speed,0,468,2,2,20
alright alright stop,0,113,2,2,297
straight left,0,20,7,7,658
okay stop stop it oh crap this crap i dont know what that was so i just flew away that works,0,113,4,4,365
ive lost control right now,0,34,10,10,469
its almost impossible to go slow,0,24,1,1,20
alright,0,404,8,8,288
so keep turn forward too much too much,0,28,2,2,100
if i do the right math wait points matter two,0,825,10,10,302
and again i noticed i have negative  oh cool i got bullets right when i said that,0,190,10,10,230
so for now once we get back in this hexagon we can start spinning counterclockwise because for some reason the tower does not seem to like to shoot when you are going around counterclockwise than if you stay on one specific side,0,848,4,4,260
slow gotta keep going slow,0,52,2,2,548
slow down no,0,569,10,10,242
alright so mumbles oh yeah i dont know what you are i dont know you,0,113,2,2,293
alright alright alright who are you what are you,0,113,6,6,434
ugh im out of control again,0,809,4,4,67
alright so its supposed to be a long wait then,0,16,9,9,745
im gonna try to slow down 10 vulnerability counter is there,0,41,2,2,348
slow down,0,12,9,9,663
alright umm no no no okay just gotta ive still yet to get any bonus points or anything,0,685,1,1,19
keep hitting back on the control pad in order to stop the motion but i realize that it doesnt,0,404,2,2,77
the spaceship is trying to,0,130,5,5,324
all right so take maneuver around,0,55,1,1,546
i had the flight plan down but yeah it took a long time,0,20,10,10,810
p center joystick top bottom thats right,0,53,3,3,93
im gonna try to move in a straight line and shoot instead,0,300,6,6,333
okay i didnt expect it to be that hard to control it,0,27,1,1,17
there may be a way i can make it slow down then,0,52,2,2,530
p stop bumping into the fortress,0,50,8,8,87
if you go super slow you make yourself vulnerable to the fortress and the mines,0,12,1,1,366
alright,0,16,5,5,359
p alright lets get it,0,16,1,1,6
usually i can get a couple of shots in without having to move too much cuz its only when i move that really messes me up,0,24,4,4,97
going too fast going too fast,0,319,7,7,186
shooting too fast thats a friendly mine,0,404,2,2,73
alright,0,28,2,2,102
alright,0,16,2,2,98
alright so its kind of like a point and then alright,0,214,1,1,197
i need to slow down slow down a bit before i fire,0,300,8,8,377
thats what i want i gotta slow down my ship here so i can shoot this thing and im dead cuz of course okay,0,41,2,2,370
alright,0,16,3,3,185
alright,0,28,9,9,385
slow myself down first,0,300,10,10,409
oh no i cant move,0,130,10,10,417
the more i see my points to 2000 the more i shoot faster,0,569,6,6,184
alright that makes sense only way to apply thrust is to pick direction you want then hit forward,0,977,1,1,55
p just bouncing off the fortress right now,0,50,2,2,17
then the next one comes moves way too easily,0,34,6,6,292
alright thats a more comfortable speed,0,647,1,1,128
6 7 im actually not doing that bad right now 8 thats a good mine 9 10 there we go,0,41,10,10,630
alright,0,825,7,7,213
alright i still got my points,0,16,9,9,730
it helps if i screen wrap but i know that messes with points oh see went to fast there,0,404,6,6,220
turn around,0,55,9,9,980
this is fine just going in circles at this point,0,113,5,5,391
slow down there,0,12,4,4,473
slow down,0,51,10,10,422
ok q ah man wrong interval too interval was too slow,0,404,4,4,155
p no like when i wrap the screen,0,211,7,7,102
whoever designed these controls really needs to work on this,0,41,1,1,295
this is really hard to control,0,26,2,2,15
alright,0,54,5,5,290
p over time i havent gotten better at controlling this thing,0,400,7,7,117
right now the fortress has 7 vulnerability,0,848,6,6,316
just trying to get control of the game,0,404,1,1,19
oh i shot to fast,0,34,4,4,211
too slow on my interval,0,41,6,6,490
i dont feel like im in control,0,210,2,2,24
alright,0,16,7,7,511
there was just the first dollar sign but that was  im still circling the fortress trying to get the best shot without getting hit,0,848,7,7,341
otherwise if i keep going in the circle i can make it to a positive score,0,400,6,6,113
i could use that as a way to stop me,0,34,2,2,82
alright ok oh my god,0,214,1,1,179
space,0,14,2,2,460
that mine appeared right where i was,0,41,3,3,383
i just want to be more competent with my left,0,53,4,4,157
is there a way to slow down,0,38,1,1,176
p this is too fast,0,127,1,1,120
yep alright,0,30,7,7,370
the other way the other way seems to be turning out better for me,0,57,7,7,1298
alright im gonna do this,0,404,7,7,245
oh enemy popped up right in my face,0,319,2,2,41
so im staying my main strategy right now is to avoid the mine and im not staying in the hexagon very much because im trying to as much as i can but its hard,0,685,6,6,134
okay no control,0,818,6,6,128
nice and slow,0,41,10,10,633
slow down,0,57,3,3,1010
80 shots left no,0,29,4,4,442
turn and slow down,0,28,3,3,136
okay were back inside the hexagon,0,34,7,7,355
p oh right,0,3,1,1,8
trying to focus to shoot it instead of staying inside the hexagon this time,0,300,4,4,282
try to rotate,0,300,8,8,379
flying backwards,0,30,9,9,515
oh i just oh thats right because it totals all the scores,0,12,5,5,535
getting out of control,0,319,4,4,100
rotate right,0,300,1,1,208
going too fast,0,848,4,4,259
2 im moving out of control for a second here,0,14,7,7,700
alright just keep going this flight plan is not working at all,0,113,2,2,285
alright 1 now im going the other way,0,825,8,8,249
p ok my question is i might just not umm been hitting the enemy fortress but once i got to ten i was trying to hit it with two shots and uh it seemed to be going right through it,0,404,5,5,192
go forward,0,20,8,8,723
albright there is one,0,54,4,4,266
okay back in control,0,818,5,5,118
when the ship starts too fast youre screwed the whole game cuz then youre gloating around like on ice skates,0,977,4,4,77
whatever im gonna okay i dont care if i go out of bounds,0,16,1,1,58
p its better not to move i feel like haha,0,18,2,2,29
alright alright alright,0,404,6,6,240
alright i gotta turn than move,0,16,6,6,445
alright bonus 2 my shots are at 53 so my next bonus im going to get bullets oh no i clicked too early dang it,0,130,9,9,409
too close to the edge,0,14,2,2,471
p  ok same controls,0,53,5,5,194
alright,0,16,5,5,406
get away from me personal space,0,53,10,10,495
p ok so im trying to control the uh ship and im playing the joystick controls not very well,0,468,1,1,3
alright definitely not getting the once youre staying in lines,0,468,1,1,13
alright im not doing as well though,0,190,4,4,175
alright slow down slow down,0,28,7,7,285
its must easier to just circle it,0,12,10,10,677
i cant never remember how fast i did these shoots,0,16,6,6,487
p ok ok thats right,0,411,1,1,4
i got way too fast on the speed,0,49,3,3,340
alright so another  sign so weapons,0,20,3,3,495
alright i really want to get the flight path down,0,20,3,3,498
p alright are people usually this bad,0,20,2,2,419
and i lost control,0,788,10,10,191
p ytn alright,0,41,8,8,541
laughs alright,0,190,1,1,112
its moving very fast,0,211,1,1,5
slow down,0,127,6,6,223
hyperspace my own element mumbles,0,468,7,7,150
im still completely out of control,0,468,4,4,61
aright,0,16,3,3,194
to the right,0,818,6,6,121
yep alright okay cool,0,30,8,8,418
ok keep it slow i see ok,0,52,2,2,544
alright,0,319,1,1,8
too fast,0,14,3,3,533
slow down,0,51,7,7,255
slow down slow down,0,411,5,5,73
oh wait i think thats right,0,28,4,4,158
right oh lord,0,24,1,1,17
alright ydm we got a g,0,16,9,9,689
okay no turn that way good yes okay now you left the screen so alright back right who are you,0,113,4,4,352
so right now im still trying my best to stay within the hexagon which has been proven better for me at this game,0,848,7,7,340
stop hitting me,0,29,1,1,331
wait i have to shh i have to turn it into no if its tba that means its,0,52,6,6,719
and slow down,0,28,8,8,344
dang turn turn turn turn dang,0,16,5,5,375
so now im just going to try to fly around and avoid everything so i can get shots,0,685,9,9,198
p okay turn come on,0,127,6,6,215
cant shoot it too fast thats a friendly mine,0,404,2,2,75
lets do this right,0,432,8,8,175
p alright,0,848,5,5,275
so dont go too fast stay in the lines theres a dollar sign it disappeared,0,468,6,6,104
ah just when i gained control again,0,155,10,10,299
alright i dont know who designed this game but its so hard,0,51,3,3,60
so right about now i am thinking i kind of want to be ambidextrous,0,53,4,4,151
now little better on this control thing,0,28,5,5,216
alright,0,26,3,3,21
turn turn,0,28,10,10,446
im not just taking hits anytime you move just strait at the fortress youre just done for,0,14,9,9,810
p im getting the interval too fast and i know im doing it too fast whenever i do it its just a habit of clicking it as fast as i can instead of thinking of the time,0,685,6,6,129
spin around and lose control,0,818,8,8,203
2 hits gotta set myself back up so it moves perfectly,0,372,6,6,74
alright,0,43,9,9,195
one personal space,0,53,6,6,265
it is not indicative of my performance uninterpretable alright i regressed,0,41,3,3,408
its not moving,0,788,10,10,182
i need to learn how to control my velocity,0,51,2,2,34
alright i which is an enemy mine,0,404,3,3,111
okay clockwise not too fast i could probably do a lot better with my right hand but yes shoot it,0,818,2,2,18
alright,0,825,1,1,11
turn,0,56,2,2,26
so why doesnt it go faster,0,33,7,7,818
frictionless is right,0,411,1,1,5
p controls,0,14,9,9,776
there you go slow and steady but,0,41,7,7,511
im just going to stay at the bottom of the screen,0,113,7,7,458
p i am not knowing how to control this,0,568,1,1,11
oh man so theres no way of slowing it down,0,211,3,3,39
i havent really been able to control much,0,848,1,1,199
alright come on come on come on come on,0,16,6,6,460
their processing speed is just so fast and their fire rate is insane,0,211,8,8,111
alright,0,319,2,2,18
turn,0,51,5,5,163
st 7 right now,0,46,5,5,458
okay turn and he got me,0,57,2,2,918
im in hyperspace getting followed by a mine which is definitely foe,0,468,6,6,111
im going too fast im out of control but we can fix that,0,319,9,9,215
turn then move,0,16,6,6,499
also moving the ship is kinda wonky it like requires you to turn it and accelerate it but the bad guy moves so much faster than you that its kinda hard to get a grip,0,411,9,9,140
alright this,0,16,9,9,748
alright alright there we go something is happening,0,113,2,2,287
but i just keep hitting the spaceship,0,130,2,2,247
i am getting close to 1200 so thats my goal right now,0,558,8,8,63
this is just alright this is just how imma do it,0,16,3,3,239
too close to the edge,0,14,2,2,470
trying to make it stay like in the hexagon but i want to go in the,0,52,1,1,511
go forward,0,51,5,5,169
turn around turn around turn around,0,127,8,8,248
every time i see tba i have to turn into i have to right click twice to turn into a friendly mine,0,52,6,6,704
slow down,0,12,4,4,476
like if youre going really fast in one direction just turn around to the opposite and then yeah and then just accelerate in that direction and um that definitely helps a lot cause now i can kind of like keep myself from flying off the,0,214,3,3,260
alright just gonna focus on sp velocity,0,28,3,3,130
ship is going too fast,0,130,3,3,275
alright,0,16,2,2,119
alright,0,26,5,5,67
all right,0,57,1,1,862
alright so instructions,0,16,4,4,265
alright,0,28,4,4,179
now i gotta remember to look down at the bottom of the screen,0,568,2,2,39
let me just keep going to the right,0,818,8,8,209
that thing follows me fast,0,51,3,3,71
im trying to go right and its not working,0,20,1,1,404
ok so i feel more in control of my actions and less of like i dont know whats going on but still trying to stay inside the lines,0,468,3,3,33
lets see yes i see my control,0,33,4,4,678
i really dont want this guy to go off the screen but he keeps wanting to do that,0,47,5,5,65
got him and died right away,0,647,7,7,205
if i could slow down and not fly over the screen,0,569,5,5,172
nice double tap slow down,0,910,8,8,191
p i keep flying outside of the hexagon which is making me lose points which isnt good,0,45,2,2,12
alright go forward,0,20,5,5,574
going forward rotating towards the fortress firing ok firing and then toward or again,0,300,1,1,201
okay keep going going to the right and not get hit,0,818,8,8,196
its mhc here right now,0,404,8,8,326
it turns so quickly,0,739,2,2,22
i got that come on slow down,0,29,4,4,430
alright,0,372,9,9,114
p uninterpretable 410 alright so i press continue,0,16,1,1,87
i can turn that into a nope its gone,0,52,6,6,709
yea your ship was damaged 13 times and screen wrapped around less than last time,0,53,3,3,133
turn,0,127,8,8,255
go right,0,20,7,7,654
and then the velocity and control are awful but that another time to deal with that,0,29,5,5,478
yeah definitely going too fast,0,468,3,3,41
alright mine down,0,28,5,5,213
okay alright okay stop exiting the screen keep turning okay i bounced off of that i dont know if thats friendly or not,0,113,2,2,283
i need control of this,0,647,8,8,217
i cant control a thing,0,155,1,1,139
it seems i do a little better going counterclockwise round instead of clockwise,0,558,4,4,20
oh im in a hexagon,0,52,5,5,663
p gotta slow down gotta slow down thats foe,0,50,8,8,96
ok so from the starting point if you just hit up you are able to uh stay out of direct path flight which  trying to fly back up alright so now we can spin through the screen,0,848,9,9,380
alright this was my work on my speed a little and i can start from there,0,49,5,5,379
using the joystick with my left hand,0,53,4,4,162
p okay so i think the main thing is to try to not get into hyperspace,0,468,1,1,10
p okay its pretty hard just feel like umm just doing this with my left hand is pretty difficult,0,319,1,1,5
p thats a lot harder than i thought it would be i didnt think it would be that sensitive to the touch and everything and your first instinct is to back thrust and you cant do that though to slow down or anything so,0,685,1,1,22
alright,0,404,7,7,247
p alright this time im finishing positive,0,16,5,5,345
going too fast going too fast,0,319,8,8,198
trying to slow down,0,3,6,6,111
out of control,0,319,5,5,136
hopefully ill destroy it 6 times im moving much slower than last time,0,825,10,10,288
and um im finding that if you start off in the hexagon and you move so like if youre going along the hexagon you just shift right there points to screen at the perfect timing you know,0,214,5,5,307
i think its actually impossible to fly in the circle,0,3,1,1,18
trying the same strategy keep moving around,0,372,6,6,73
im trying to slow down,0,12,8,8,620
the closer i get to it the control zone is very hard to stay in because i get hit pretty fast,0,404,4,4,160
alright,0,28,10,10,439
my reaction time is a little bit slower cause i have to look at the ifs thing remember what the letters were and then shoot at it,0,411,7,7,107
i lost control,0,818,5,5,117
going around the circle is not working for me,0,46,6,6,481
alright cool,0,190,3,3,170
ok so i have 68 shots left,0,54,5,5,305
this round i was able to keep control positive but everything else is still negative,0,848,4,4,270
p it seems like purposely running into the fortress can be a good idea because then you dont run out of bounds,0,513,4,4,58
so this is right this is left this is straight,0,20,7,7,649
there is a mine on the screen which is an l,0,848,9,9,392
i cant  no stop stop,0,113,1,1,241
i really dont know how to slow down and i cant seem to aim really at all,0,558,1,1,4
space fortress is mumbles enemy mine,0,319,7,7,175
p i know the objective is to keep going around in circles like that but i just cant control it well enough at this point to do that so,0,127,4,4,178
and i still cant control this ship because it has a mind of its own,0,20,1,1,399
uh how does it expect you to stay within the circle,0,825,3,3,101
avoid getting shot trying to go a little slower,0,24,1,1,19
alright gotcha gotcha gotcha,0,214,8,8,348
alright so were staying on the same side got shot once unfortunately the space ship is spinning out of control and i got shot and died again,0,848,5,5,286
alright oh n is enemy they move very fast by the time i look down and register hes almost on top of me,0,404,6,6,219
there you go oh no too fast,0,130,6,6,335
uggghhh go forward,0,30,3,3,133
alright,0,28,2,2,88
going too fast around this,0,46,2,2,379
slow down,0,51,6,6,211
trying to do this with my left hand is definitely hindering my point game,0,818,3,3,38
oh alright then i have to pay attention i have to pay attention to that a little bit more,0,825,4,4,139
p yeah umm i wrapped the screen 32 times definitely better upgrade,0,568,2,2,53
no were off into hyperspace,0,818,4,4,81
i dont know why they turn to asteroids,0,24,10,10,231
im moving in a square again,0,300,6,6,320
alright,0,127,7,7,236
its very slippery im staying outside of the control line a lot which is very difficult to stay in and when it starts immediately and the fortress gets off the first shot that i really cannot avoid,0,404,1,1,21
p alright,0,20,3,3,465
gonna learn how to move,0,16,8,8,655
p alright,0,848,1,1,211
mmm if i go too fast it doesnt even shoot at me so thats good,0,404,10,10,384
alright umm the vulnerability is still at 0 so i cannot attack the fortress,0,372,1,1,15
slowing down making sure i stay in the hexagon this time,0,300,9,9,403
alright,0,16,3,3,219
so with the mines its better to shoot them right away then check while youre shooting to see whether or not theyre enemy or friendly and if they are enemy then take down the defenses and if theyre friendly you already shot them,0,681,6,6,285
alright,0,319,4,4,79
p xfp alright okay and already entered hyperspace,0,41,1,1,292
oh i can ic an even fire at ait i can literally be firing at it right now,0,52,8,8,794
p clockwise,0,432,8,8,184
an enemy and a bonus but aw man that was really fast,0,130,9,9,408
p its fast,0,40,1,1,49
come on turn around,0,55,10,10,1027
p yeah like between right there and where you spawn,0,211,4,4,50
alright come on lets go,0,568,2,2,40
trying to stay inside the hexagon while shooting it,0,130,5,5,316
ok so im definitely not in control right now,0,468,3,3,37
not doing too entirely bad this game yet so far but what im trying to do is stay in the hexagon the best that i can the fortess,0,848,3,3,234
i got to slow down thats what i need to do,0,54,9,9,446
alright three minutes its done,0,53,10,10,498
just fly up fly up,0,30,9,9,495
alright destroyed the fortress i have positive points finally i got 310,0,372,8,8,99
completely forgot the controls for a second,0,14,2,2,478
once you lose control its very hard to get it back,0,12,7,7,577
ah turn turn turn turn  mumbling,0,210,4,4,43
pretty in control with this o thats a friendly mine oh man i hit the wrong button,0,404,5,5,178
okay alright,0,825,2,2,56
im not even staying in the circle,0,51,3,3,63
im not losing points for going to hyperspace but mumbles,0,468,4,4,48
no i had 10 velocity,0,34,9,9,414
i mean im always in hyperspace anyway,0,53,8,8,367
alright turn and move,0,16,4,4,276
i guess it kind of says down if you turn the way that you wanna go,0,57,2,2,889
alright come on where you at,0,16,7,7,527
to the left,0,56,1,1,11
press rotate,0,300,8,8,383
this hexagon oh man,0,130,5,5,325
swipe right,0,27,1,1,19
got to slow down,0,52,3,3,562
turn,0,28,2,2,80
as long as im moving ever so slightly i should umm,0,24,3,3,84
oh no too fast too fast,0,818,4,4,75
dont move,0,12,4,4,497
i just wish i could use my right hand,0,53,2,2,60
i stopped caring whether or not i stay in the hexagon,0,400,2,2,62
mumbles instructions on screen,0,33,2,2,583
right now it is already back to 3,0,848,5,5,294
wait slow slow,0,53,3,3,123
accelerating left,0,910,3,3,82
alright no calm okay yes,0,113,4,4,350
just moving up and down,0,411,9,9,133
p i just dont remember if its right,0,3,3,3,56
okay were positive right now,0,34,4,4,163
im actually gaining hits on this thing ill get no control points but i think i can take the hit honestly how this game is so hard to control,0,404,2,2,83
im moving around shooting at him im almost at 10,0,300,4,4,291
p its just really hard to control right now,0,27,1,1,6
it goes really fast,0,3,1,1,9
p im trying to go in the counterclockwise pathway but im struggling a little bit,0,45,1,1,5
alright destroyed the fortress twice getting better at it now,0,809,3,3,63
alright,0,127,2,2,155
i almost died but i got it and i only have 136 points right now so im doing a lot better than ive been doing,0,685,7,7,157
p alright,0,127,2,2,146
at this point just trying to get used to the controls and not fly off in some random direction,0,14,1,1,437
going too fast going too fast,0,319,8,8,208
its hard to stay inside the hexagon,0,809,1,1,22
stop moving so fast slow down slow down,0,16,8,8,616
n 5 5 velocity,0,41,9,9,601
alright,0,16,4,4,336
alright oh gotta keep moving,0,28,5,5,223
trying to get a hang of the controls first,0,681,1,1,204
keep trying to shoot too fast as well,0,12,3,3,439
okay stop leaving the screen no no,0,113,4,4,348
slow down,0,51,4,4,92
slow down,0,454,10,10,252
alright k thats friendly,0,404,8,8,320
okay so how do i slow down again,0,57,9,9,1422
alright lets get this party stared,0,54,5,5,292
take it slow down i do dont something,0,52,1,1,499
going too fast,0,319,7,7,184
alright what this is,0,16,5,5,376
ok i got 3 vulnerability points not flying out control yet,0,809,3,3,51
no cant control,0,210,6,6,88
not even using the mouse right now,0,404,2,2,69
so my screen warping is getting well better,0,825,3,3,125
i kind of assumed that if i move my ship to the right that it would automatically go on a trail to the hold on like to the right but it does not,0,558,2,2,10
okay so for this one im just going to try and wrap the screen as many times as possible and just shoot when i have the opportunity,0,372,5,5,58
p yeah that seems to be the best course here cause trying to go in a circle like it wants me to is just kinda frustrating,0,411,10,10,145
control was significantly worse,0,3,4,4,75
since whenever you move in ac ertain direction you keep moving in that direction,0,12,5,5,522
no no cause the spacebar doesnt do anything,0,52,1,1,496
nope mumbles alright,0,739,10,10,102
alright,0,788,3,3,84
slow your speed,0,51,6,6,180
keep moving keep moving keep moving,0,14,4,4,554
mumbles i dont know why i stopped there,0,300,9,9,391
uh im moving backwards,0,3,6,6,96
this is too much this is too much stop stop stop,0,113,1,1,243
okay if i just slow down somehow,0,57,3,3,1008
at 5 vulnerability friendly mine right there,0,319,2,2,29
p well i can see this is a large difference from my first trial because before i couldnt get the thing to stay on the screen,0,190,9,9,215
p youre right,0,3,3,3,53
im gunna try something different im gunna try a fly by tactic,0,910,2,2,36
please stop shooting me,0,41,7,7,520
okay move there we go,0,910,2,2,40
one personal space,0,53,6,6,256
now im out of control again,0,809,2,2,41
alright cool,0,28,8,8,359
yup turn then move,0,16,6,6,446
just keep on moving thats one dollar sign,0,14,9,9,790
okay out of space here,0,41,1,1,327
slightly better but my points on velocity and control arent great,0,46,8,8,570
okay seem to be going slow and the slower i go the more velocity points i get,0,34,10,10,481
one thing i noticed is it shoots you right as soon as you start so you start with negative points,0,685,5,5,96
its just that nothing really comes to mind other than trying to move,0,910,1,1,14
slow down,0,51,6,6,217
and ive noticed that the fortress doesnt shoot until it has you stopped somewhere you know so if you move or if you like mumbling,0,214,6,6,323
alright i got 1500 points more this time really excited,0,558,2,2,13
p i keep pulling it backwards but it doesnt work,0,50,2,2,18
new zoom velocity,0,57,4,4,1041
one dollar sign damn hyperspace,0,468,10,10,216
it would to be respond right when you start cause he shoots you right away,0,647,7,7,208
p so right now points are very off ive been doing terribly havent been paying attention to the things that have been showing up but right now ive kind of figured out how to stay in the middle somewhat,0,848,2,2,225
p alright,0,24,1,1,47
so for this game we are going to do what we did last game and stay within the fortress trying to keep shooting the fortress as much as possible but staying at a clockwise,0,848,8,8,351
oh yeah alright i see how im a i see how imma duck these things,0,16,3,3,237
so we got 2 shots right now,0,34,5,5,243
see why doesnt it go faster,0,33,7,7,805
i shot too fast to reset the vulnerability counter,0,12,4,4,477
its a little easier to know to stop your rotation,0,685,7,7,146
velocity low,0,130,4,4,298
slow down,0,127,10,10,283
alright im just gonna circle around the horizon,0,16,9,9,723
no oh phf so i double right click thats not ugh,0,52,7,7,749
the fort moves slower than i do,0,12,2,2,408
thats a friendly but im just gunna run right into the,0,825,2,2,79
oh alright just hit the enemy mine actually pretty proud of myself when i do that i dont get that much,0,404,6,6,228
how fast im posta,0,16,6,6,457
alright,0,300,8,8,378
gotta try in the control zone certainly ah,0,404,4,4,166
thats better than negative right,0,804,9,9,384
aright come on,0,16,7,7,572
a lot faster than i thought it would be,0,910,1,1,5
also kind of hard to keep my ships velocity right,0,681,1,1,200
stay on the screen come on man,0,739,5,5,55
alright go straight come on,0,210,6,6,82
okay so turn turn turn turn,0,57,2,2,926
next time i see the dollar buttons im going to click left,0,468,4,4,60
right,0,26,2,2,13
controlling this is hard,0,788,3,3,92
oh that was my worst score right there,0,558,10,10,77
alright so i have no points at this point so i forgot the letters,0,113,1,1,256
alright,0,214,10,10,393
slow down,0,51,4,4,115
alright i it was ezekiel so thats a friend,0,20,8,8,707
moving way too quickly,0,14,3,3,526
so im trying just to like control this ship its very sensitive and intense so my focus is going to that but i probably should play attention to mines,0,190,1,1,108
alright,0,404,8,8,304
alright so on this one we will be trying the same go back and forth on the same side as well as we can do that or if we can try and combine the two ideas from before of flying through the screen and flying on the same side,0,848,6,6,304
this round has been going much better because i have been staying at a slow velocity,0,848,10,10,402
how do i move this over here,0,658,1,1,8
alright,0,28,2,2,73
i ran into that one like i completely lost control,0,825,6,6,185
p all right again i know,0,57,3,3,961
so the only difficult thing about the game is that you move uncontrollably,0,513,2,2,43
i need to right click then turn it into,0,52,3,3,599
alright now i know how i gotta stick a move okay i gotta stick a move,0,16,2,2,130
out of control,0,319,9,9,226
tryna avoid hyperspace now earlier in the game i wasnt,0,34,10,10,454
still gotta get the interval timing right to identify the mines,0,681,5,5,275
alright straight right,0,20,7,7,680
turn,0,57,2,2,931
so to get the bonus the points is mouse left,0,54,5,5,282
im just going to stop shooting,0,113,6,6,423
im going too slow,0,16,2,2,126
there is definitely a way to make it go slower but i cannot think of that,0,52,2,2,549
all right dollar sign,0,55,6,6,757
rotating to the right i keep focusing on the fortress,0,300,6,6,324
these tight ass turns,0,16,5,5,388
alright,0,16,1,1,18
alright,0,16,1,1,40
p oh right sorry,0,3,1,1,11
slow down,0,28,1,1,25
of course it hits me when i went into hyperspace i didnt know what was gonna come out there,0,804,10,10,400
umm i still have to get used to how sensitive the controller er the joystick is,0,468,2,2,26
slow and steady just tap it,0,41,5,5,472
probably wasnt a good strategy because i was out of the hexagon,0,977,6,6,95
in clockwise direction while i shoot,0,54,7,7,407
alright,0,16,3,3,207
i love how it just wants you to fly around the hexagon but like yea no,0,53,1,1,25
i wasnt even paying attention to the mine im just so focused on flying,0,41,9,9,589
i dont think you slow down,0,57,1,1,828
p okay alright so thats a friendly mine,0,28,1,1,60
ok so i think im definitely getting the controls a bit more each time its no longer like a umm oh maybe i can start playing the game,0,468,5,5,83
all i gotta do is keep gdoing what i was doing keep to the right go slow and well get this eventually,0,818,7,7,190
alright,0,16,4,4,342
yeah just keep flying around,0,113,2,2,307
and it lets me only move the joystick in a very like parallel movements if that makes sense,0,411,10,10,147
my score is slowly going down,0,804,8,8,373
alright so you just oh no thats not a foe but now it is,0,214,8,8,351
slow down,0,57,2,2,932
its kind of rough because the only way to slow down is moving forward in the opposite direction,0,400,2,2,59
alright q,0,16,4,4,300
like move out of the way,0,190,3,3,156
its too fast,0,46,1,1,359
yeah lets just fly straight at it,0,14,6,6,676
come on lets move out the way alright,0,16,9,9,739
go slower ok cool,0,211,8,8,113
oh i keep looping around but in how do i slow down,0,57,7,7,1311
alright i ran into that so the fortress shoots like immediately,0,190,1,1,117
alright thats round 4,0,825,4,4,154
ill probably get a good control score,0,825,10,10,300
alright,0,685,2,2,31
go forward,0,51,5,5,159
flying in circles,0,20,6,6,634
alright,0,53,7,7,303
ok turn,0,210,5,5,65
like i said about the inverted youre so used to one side of the screen then the controls just change,0,977,10,10,117
immeadiately moves and gets hit,0,12,3,3,452
my control has been good,0,825,10,10,299
okay but velocity that was one of them,0,57,4,4,1050
now now right there,0,57,1,1,861
oh going too fast,0,319,4,4,81
theres the turnaround,0,40,5,5,95
slowly drift away,0,14,7,7,693
not into hyper drive,0,14,4,4,563
okay i have one shot left,0,41,3,3,402
i got it right there,0,16,1,1,73
its hard to stay in this octagon i mean hexagon,0,454,3,3,181
alright,0,404,5,5,196
turn around,0,28,2,2,74
they always go counterclockwise,0,57,5,5,1126
its like impossible to shoot right,0,3,2,2,32

im getting the wholes hitting the center thing its hard to focus on the control paneling while doing other stuff,0,647,2,2,136
f mine thats bad mine i gotta do the too quick on the interval and im still trying to gain control this is really difficult i got shot i getting shot again,0,41,1,1,314
friendly mine mumbles still going way too fast,0,848,1,1,198
hey go forward,0,28,1,1,14
between the key so like see like its the exact time that you need to press to change so that you dont go too fast,0,214,5,5,308
go forward,0,20,1,1,403
p alright umm the hardest part to me is staying inside the hexagon umm and i guess yeah staying inside the hexagon is probably the hardest thing,0,685,2,2,27
2 5 oh too fast dang it,0,211,10,10,132
too fast too fast too fast,0,14,2,2,493
your shipped wrapped around the screen 42 times,0,53,2,2,88

im getting too busy staying in the circle and im forgetting to shoot,0,20,7,7,664
dog i cannot turn for shit,0,16,9,9,700
umm im doing a little bit better i think the control on this game is a lot better on this game than the other games and its the last game so i didnt expect it to be better,0,685,10,10,222
going way too fast,0,848,1,1,208
if im going too slowly itll get me,0,46,9,9,583
yeah it would take me a long time to learn how to control this thing here,0,127,5,5,201
slow down,0,51,9,9,371
74 shots left,0,372,2,2,27
left click,0,51,6,6,221

i even drew a flight pattern i knew when to turn,0,53,10,10,480
its turning,0,55,6,6,777
alright woah woah where are you going,0,53,5,5,218
alright so uhh because im pressing all the keys,0,52,1,1,486
alright im start moving,0,54,5,5,322
no were just gonna lose complete control,0,818,7,7,184
i just reset my vulnerability cuz im losing control,0,14,9,9,785
alright gotta get a little bit faster,0,568,2,2,48
p alright the foes are umh,0,372,2,2,21
how do you slow down,0,647,1,1,129
im just gonna move like this nope that aint gonna work,0,16,9,9,728
lemmy get this moving down,0,16,1,1,45
alright same shit,0,16,9,9,685
and im basically just out of control at this point,0,14,1,1,439
slow down,0,51,3,3,73
i pride myself in this type of stuff but i do not feel good right now,0,49,9,9,485
the focus is going slow again,0,300,5,5,299
come on just wanna rotate,0,30,2,2,69
ill just fly around until theres another bonus,0,3,7,7,144
so right click,0,14,7,7,719
flying flying everywhere,0,647,4,4,166
okay oh my god im going way too fast,0,818,1,1,13
okay thats fast,0,51,3,3,59
but its difficult to control this thing,0,54,8,8,424
alright o that is an enemy so i have to wait,0,20,9,9,765
there we go nice and slow,0,41,10,10,617
alright so i got hit again im still trying to stay on the same side and go at a somewhat slow velocity,0,848,5,5,291
get hit right at the start,0,46,3,3,398
fly up fly up fly up fly up,0,30,10,10,522
and then ill confuse the shoot button with forward and ill miss shots,0,432,3,3,126
two personal space,0,53,6,6,266
hyperspace game,0,53,6,6,290
come on left hand,0,16,4,4,263
get more control,0,130,5,5,328
get it right,0,454,2,2,161
alright i think i clicked it too rapidly and now this thing is coming to kill me,0,558,5,5,34
there was just another mine on the screen but that one was friendly so it was able to be shot,0,848,7,7,335
stop,0,51,6,6,177
when the foe mines are dq and n i have to try and turn them into friendly mines by double clicking which i feel can kill,0,52,9,9,819
turn,0,56,4,4,50
alright heres the thing,0,28,2,2,67
really wish i could get to a slower but i cant seem to do that,0,52,9,9,821
straight right straight right and left left straight oh ok straight make a right go back go straight alright come on,0,20,7,7,661
come on rotate,0,127,8,8,251
ah alright go around okay keep him there,0,210,3,3,36
basically alright im going to try this,0,51,2,2,36
p so i have a little better understanding of what is going on because i actually just realized that i am supposed to like the ship turns and i boost it its not actually moving in the direction if that makes any sense at all,0,558,2,2,9
alright alright just got to take shots,0,113,10,10,533
mumbles going too fast going way too fast,0,319,3,3,63
p there is no strategy going on here i will tell you that right now im just trying to get a hold of the controls here,0,568,1,1,17
p i mean its not really controlling not really moving,0,18,1,1,23
mumbles alright now im trying to fly around the fortress the best as possible without going over but got shot,0,848,3,3,240
finally stopped getting hit immediately,0,24,2,2,68
we have to go the opposite way to accelerate daf no that was me,0,130,7,7,373
i probably gotta turn the other way,0,16,9,9,696
oh no alright and,0,33,4,4,677
alright thats maybe slightly worse mumble,0,468,3,3,43
alright,0,818,2,2,23
having trouble controlling it,0,46,4,4,432
slow down,0,51,8,8,315
slow and i still dont know how to control this,0,29,6,6,498
moving too fast,0,3,7,7,123
too fast,0,647,9,9,223
all right hashtag,0,55,8,8,909
my strategy is to move to the ends of the hexagon before shooting the fortress,0,300,8,8,384
alright,0,739,10,10,106
friend or foe mouse right,0,54,5,5,286
i mean i got a horrible score but that was the closest i got i just thought i just keep when i heard the rules it has to be under 250 for your last two shots so thats why i keep hitting it really fast but its over 250 but like consecutive like twice in a row,0,404,7,7,278
okay im trying to control it,0,51,1,1,4
rotate come on come on,0,127,6,6,227
i got the bonus too alright,0,33,9,9,875
almost a complete hexagon,0,52,5,5,664
alright,0,788,8,8,157
alright,0,404,8,8,291
vulnerability at 3 which is good im not at total negative points right now,0,804,7,7,333
p yeah alright back to 2,0,558,4,4,26
like if im like right here it always misses,0,57,9,9,1396
not worried about bonuses right now,0,28,3,3,132
ship doesnt slow down at all,0,804,1,1,240
the way the hexagon is shaped its kind of like it makes it a bit easier if you just follow the shape of the hexagon like you should be able to stay in that you know,0,214,5,5,293
p bdm thats too close to bdsm alright,0,29,9,9,570
p oh alright,0,190,8,8,203
so lets try to cancel out my normal points with the velocity points,0,34,10,10,483
actually staying in the control zone more than i thought it would,0,404,8,8,322
trying to slow myself down going too fast,0,300,10,10,421
alright here we go,0,28,10,10,409
alright here we go,0,28,8,8,365
mumbling turn around turn around go go go straight there,0,210,5,5,64
if im always pointing at the hexagon im good,0,57,6,6,1243
turn,0,818,10,10,252
96 shots left,0,26,4,4,54
lemmy learn how to turn,0,16,4,4,287
the controls are really the hardest part im having a hard part controlling the ship at all much less worrying about the mines,0,404,1,1,27
stop it,0,52,9,9,834
alright my ship moves then to apply thrust it doesnt like the opposite key 4 and 6 and then the opposite key 2 and 8 doesnt really work,0,977,1,1,53
i was like i knew controlling the ship was going to be pretty difficult but i didnt realize that everything was going to be so fast paced,0,404,4,4,126
oops see now im completely out of control,0,319,2,2,31
try to move slowly not bother with anything other than moving,0,14,1,1,443
right now its at 6,0,46,5,5,451
alright lets get it,0,16,5,5,393
we cannot lose these points right now,0,20,9,9,756
p what im trying to do is trying to get control,0,788,2,2,64
theres completely no how do you control this thing,0,214,1,1,187
p its pretty fastpaced,0,38,3,3,197
p alright playing the full game,0,14,2,2,459
alright,0,190,2,2,134
i should really stop passing i should really stop just coasting around this,0,825,3,3,100
ok so i may not be staying in the middle as much as i want to but i definitely feel more in control of my movements,0,468,7,7,164
just coast right on by,0,818,10,10,271
slow it down,0,28,5,5,208
i cant tell if its a bad idea or not but its better than what it was at least i its flying off into hyper space,0,569,2,2,123
i am staying on the screen more,0,53,4,4,179
going all over the screen,0,739,9,9,96
stabilized now keep wrapping around the hexagon,0,809,4,4,77
im just trying to figure out cuz i cant hit the fortress unless i make it vulnerable unless i kill the mine first right if its a friend mine,0,49,4,4,370
alright so foe,0,809,7,7,128
your ship wrapped the screen 28 times,0,54,1,1,199
p alright,0,26,1,1,10
im starting to lose control again,0,788,10,10,185
all i know is that im being an idiot with how im flying around,0,14,5,5,620
alright come on man,0,16,7,7,577
wish it didnt shoot right away when the game starts makes it a little difficult,0,34,7,7,338
p alright,0,685,1,1,20
alright 6 6 7 7 i got the bonus and got hit at the same time,0,29,8,8,566
p alright,0,568,2,2,35
okay i already died so i guess im just assessing this right,0,113,5,5,377
dam those i thought i was slidin alright come on,0,16,5,5,380
hold on slow down,0,56,7,7,94
oh that is a friend alright alright,0,20,7,7,672
alright,0,568,1,1,15
is it i gotta slow down,0,41,4,4,440
had to turn it into a,0,52,5,5,681
alrighty,0,41,2,2,342
i pretty much have to hit it two more times right,0,404,5,5,209
turn and move,0,16,4,4,277
move it around,0,130,10,10,416
okay well im kind getting how the movement works,0,34,9,9,417
oh lets get out of here and hyperspace,0,34,7,7,354
trying to slow down taking,0,14,1,1,449
i cant i have to turn that into a and then,0,52,5,5,672
no its too slow,0,29,6,6,487
i need to slow down,0,53,8,8,388
turn,0,57,8,8,1344
alright fxd are the enemy mines,0,319,3,3,48
i thought that was right,0,16,3,3,209
already out of control here and got it,0,155,6,6,233
just slow down,0,14,2,2,479
atleast i got the bonuses right now,0,210,3,3,28
just go to the right,0,818,9,9,218
mumbles thats a friendly mine right there,0,319,2,2,26
this is the key to it going slow like they say in the video that mine is bad just threw me for a loop okay really slow down i should have taken the bonus shots,0,41,5,5,455
it accelerates so quickly,0,52,1,1,507
and i okay okay ive lost control a little bit,0,685,2,2,30
p yeah ive never been in space so i dont have too much experience,0,190,2,2,123
hey stop hitting me,0,113,3,3,323
control,0,54,4,4,276
im completely forgetting to shoot cuz im trying to get used to controls and mines are a pain in the but,0,14,1,1,445
turn,0,127,6,6,217
go forward,0,51,5,5,162
alright its getting a little easier now after 7 games im able to oh shoot okay,0,685,7,7,144
x friendly mine try to shoot it alright just hit it,0,404,7,7,268
i keep going into hyperspace though,0,34,2,2,73
how can i make this thing slow down,0,52,2,2,535
as soon as you start the fortress gets hits on you for real like its just restarting up slow,0,804,3,3,258
okay im dead okay my velocity score is actually not that x is a good mine,0,41,5,5,462
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,7,7,584
usually when its closer or go slower i do worse,0,211,6,6,87
so double right click and then shoot at it,0,52,10,10,862
just slow down,0,30,5,5,244
still trying to gain control,0,41,1,1,318
i dont like how it shoots me right awaythats all im saying,0,3,2,2,30
it moves so fast that,0,127,1,1,139
so when you see a foe mine youre supposed to press the right mouse button twice right,0,411,5,5,80
i think i got a little bit of control,0,372,1,1,8
need to slow down,0,28,8,8,342
come on slow down slow down slow down,0,127,10,10,287
the controller inverted that is kind of frustrating,0,977,3,3,73
didnt get hit right away,0,804,7,7,313
14 shots left,0,26,3,3,39
left click,0,51,6,6,220
so if i double click i can go faster but i dont want it to go faster,0,54,10,10,470
too fast,0,809,6,6,105
going slow enough so ican see,0,569,7,7,209
because then it flips if i get out of bounds,0,57,4,4,1079
going too fast,0,49,4,4,362
p im still attempting to fly in a counterclockwise direction but its a lot harder than i anticipated it but i feel like im getting the hang of it slowly,0,45,2,2,15
circles,0,26,7,7,117
22 shots left,0,26,5,5,79
4 5 so fast now,0,211,10,10,139
and im not even like able to think about the foes im really just stuck trying to control the ship,0,214,2,2,228
im not really grasping the whole thrust thing,0,977,1,1,51
no i was too slow,0,34,3,3,124
come on get turned around,0,55,10,10,998
okay way to slow,0,34,2,2,101
5 vulnerability right now i only need oh no,0,130,5,5,322
alright were moving very slowly,0,28,2,2,99
alright,0,16,8,8,651
got the right keys this time,0,46,8,8,537
alright,0,16,3,3,248
alright what is it,0,16,5,5,365
ive also just kind of completelt disregardedsp control and velocity at this point and focused on getting mine hits,0,12,3,3,431
slowly,0,28,4,4,174
i lost control of that,0,685,9,9,201
i should be able to hold it at a diagonal and that around thing in that hexagon but that is not been working for me,0,47,7,7,103
this thing is moving fast,0,818,1,1,9
no no just flying around,0,818,9,9,228
right click when theres no uh mine on the screen,0,52,10,10,852
i need to slow down,0,54,6,6,367
it keeps you in control,0,214,5,5,311
no for everything ive done so far i havent havent turned a friendly mine into a foe mine,0,41,6,6,495
still dint move fast enough,0,12,3,3,445
alright right now im just trying to not mumbles,0,468,1,1,12
that was also a foe so i will have to avoid that mine and reset the game plan because i  once you leave the flight pattern it is very hard to get it back,0,848,9,9,390
straight straight left ok straight oh that didnt work out,0,20,7,7,673
now control this is really evil,0,41,3,3,398
alright,0,54,1,1,200
is it when the when the little money sign like doesnt it like have to appear twice in one round for me to get the thing or can it like i killed a spaceship in between them,0,40,5,5,93
i thats a friendly alright im at 10,0,404,9,9,342
alright,0,28,8,8,362
whats going on right now,0,739,4,4,42
in the hexagon in the hexagon,0,52,2,2,551
alright 6 vulnerability,0,33,4,4,684
alright 9 vulnerability im 1 shot away from dying,0,41,10,10,642
ok now i got a little hang of it still kind of uncontrolled,0,210,2,2,22
i like the counterclockwise,0,432,2,2,113
alright,0,319,5,5,112
the screen went black,0,910,1,1,21
flew right into shots,0,3,6,6,105
p im trying to figure out the controls,0,49,1,1,253
p try to keep control here,0,50,10,10,123
ah no turn ah theres a mine,0,33,2,2,598
alright i gotta go up,0,49,2,2,287
5 row diamond thing need to stop following me,0,569,4,4,159
im not supposed to be flying out of there i lose points,0,20,3,3,508
just so many working parts you have to move immediately or else this guy will shoot you but if you move too fast you might as well restart,0,977,9,9,112
i aint cluch with the right clicks,0,16,9,9,750
hyperspace i can see now,0,127,10,10,289
okay so this is definitely the best flight pattern,0,12,8,8,613
slow down,0,51,6,6,207
it moves differently sometimes,0,211,2,2,21
my velocity needs to go up,0,33,7,7,819
oh slow,0,28,7,7,305
alright lets get it,0,16,3,3,245
no no stop,0,14,5,5,598
p alright,0,127,7,7,231
moving too fast again,0,12,2,2,416
p so i pretty much like given up on trying to stay in the hexagon cuz im just going all over the place but its mumbles no,0,190,2,2,143
i think i also forget i can shoot faster than mumbles every 5 seconds,0,432,6,6,155
its difficult to juts stay in the hexagon when youre moving and trying to shoot at the fortress too,0,54,3,3,234
all right so dollar sign,0,57,1,1,839
turn turn turn come on,0,127,6,6,214
alright thats one dollar sign,0,16,4,4,295
tilt it a little bit going too fast going too fast dollar sign shows up the first time friendly mine on screen second dollar sign,0,319,7,7,165
and turn again,0,28,2,2,76
okay slow down slow down,0,41,4,4,434
come on alright bad,0,16,3,3,238
514 alrighty,0,41,5,5,471
focusing on the base right now not the mines,0,300,10,10,417
personal space,0,53,6,6,255
alright ok oh no,0,53,2,2,70
alright,0,16,3,3,211
i cant control it,0,29,8,8,563
but theres a dollar sign thatssecond dollar sign 77 shots left,0,130,6,6,338
going very fast dont know why,0,29,4,4,412
alright thats a bonus,0,825,5,5,167
everything is coming from control which is weird cause i dont feel in control,0,12,7,7,607
quails stop x rays because their shells are really hard,0,53,10,10,454
also slow down,0,12,3,3,453
its slow down,0,12,7,7,587
nah thats just cuz im clicking too fast,0,30,9,9,509
slow,0,210,8,8,135
alright 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 destroyed it,0,372,6,6,76
im like trying to stay on the screen,0,214,3,3,251
damn alright im just gonna ride,0,16,8,8,647
okay i dont care if i go out of bounds,0,16,2,2,103
alright one  sign,0,20,3,3,478
its just the ship moves so fast,0,214,2,2,226
i need to slow myself down first and line myself first and slowly cross the base,0,300,10,10,415
p hgt okay if its hg and t stop them if its not well im gunna forget this is only round two,0,825,2,2,46
alright,0,16,5,5,360
slow down,0,51,3,3,56
p that is a friendly mine obviously out of control ok,0,404,5,5,190
actually managing to get off a lot of shots im at 6 right now,0,404,3,3,114
and we are flying through the corner of the ship so i believe the points are counterbalanced,0,848,9,9,385
i feel like if i move at all im going to go out of control,0,809,2,2,47
i just never had to play a game where you had to like point in the direction you wanted to move and then go in that direction,0,214,4,4,270
turn then move,0,16,6,6,498
alright,0,16,5,5,402
whenever you go really fast its easier to die than to stabilize yourself because its never going to work,0,513,5,5,64
im pretty sure like with like the right control like 1000 points is definitely obtainable,0,825,5,5,160
dont know if thats right,0,3,10,10,219
it takes a lot of control like i know if my brother were to try this he would be very like frantic and that wouldnt be like that would be difficult like hes,0,825,5,5,161
inaudible okay one life left per game,0,27,2,2,31
slow down,0,29,4,4,414
when youre moving too fast its probably best to just like let yourself fly off the screen cause then you can like instead of turning around it does it for you basically,0,12,4,4,482
trying to keep it on the screen,0,739,3,3,32
i keep thinking that the bonus is my like controller,0,52,6,6,731
p when i saw the lkc i tried to remember it as okc like the oklahoma city thunder so hopefully that will help a little bit remembering those but control is still extremely bad,0,558,5,5,31
stop shooting at me so i can move,0,14,3,3,535
okay lemmy move out the way,0,16,1,1,31
p alright same shit,0,16,6,6,434
